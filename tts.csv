1657974418,CEO_of_Redd1t,Explaining why the MCU is Earth-616 now in the best way I can...,"So there's been a lot of discussion lately about the MCU's designation as Earth-616. Some people have called it a mistake, others have tried to explain it with in-universe lore and others have accepted it as 616.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here today to try and do my best at explaining why the MCU is being called 616 now, and why it actually makes (some) sense. So without further ado let's begin!

&amp;#x200B;

First: The TVA and Earth 838

[The TVA's Tape](https://preview.redd.it/aemvzgzw4xb91.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd6f8daaaeaf659060c8ded0bc8cb0a09cb20b00)

So as you may know, the TVA and Baxter Foundation (from Earth 838) have both independently designated the main MCU timeline as 616. This has been the deal breaker for many theories that claim that Earth 838 was making their own unique designations, as that is clearly not the case.

My theory is this: The Baxter Foundation of 838 (with its knowledge of other universes and Incursions) is aware of the multiversal calamity and the multiversal power -The TVA- trying to fix it.

My prediction for Loki S2 is that we will see 838 (and various other universes) be involved the multiversal shenanigans, possibly merging the Baxter Foundation and a version of the TVA (since as we are led to believe at the end of Loki S1, the TVA appears to have branched) which gives them the info and data surrounding other universes that we then see in Dr Strange MOM.

&amp;#x200B;

Second: Nate Moore's Statement and Kevin Feige

[Kevin Feige](https://preview.redd.it/lnjoqo7h6xb91.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8b2798d2f0161d0a3aaadfeefcea40a9164f7a)

Nate Moore (A producer at Marvel Studios) has gone on record to say that the MCU is in Earth-616.

Kevin Feige (The President of Marvel Studios) seems to agree with this, as Iman Vellani (the actor who portrayed Ms. Marvel) mentioned how Feige made a '616' with his hands towards her during her AMA on r/marvelstudios.

Both men are higher-ups at Marvel, which would suggest that they know what they're talking about. But how can that be? How can those designations from the TVA, Earth-838, Kevin Feige and Nate Moore be true? Well, that leads me to the final part of this post:

&amp;#x200B;

Third: How it works in-universe.

Some of you may be pretty familiar with pop-culture's designs for the 'omniverse' (everything there is, can be, has been and will be) so may know what I'm talking about when I mention the term: 'megaverse'.

The term megaverse is one of the smaller parts of the overall 'archverse' heirachy, essentially being the multiverse of the multiverse. A megaverse contains infinite multiverses, which each contain infinite universes.

We've seen examples of megaverses in Marvel when the Marvel and DC universes met in the 'Amalgam universe' in the comics in the DC vs Marvel comic run. 'The Brothers' are essentially the two multiverses combining in a megaverse.

[The Brothers](https://preview.redd.it/h5384rec8xb91.jpg?width=461&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25a8c4895d0f2ab8565805d93bf980751915def1)

[The Amalgam](https://preview.redd.it/sqp30rec8xb91.jpg?width=323&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95825ef0d2aaa983262c473855ded01c44db13cc)

Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is this: The MCU is Earth-616, but in a different multiverse. 

The MCU was originally designated as Earth-199999, but it hasn't been labelled that for some time now. It appears to me that the MCU now exists in the same state that our universe (yes us) does. Earth Prime is our designation in DC and Earth-1218 in Marvel. The same universe (as far as I can tell) in two different multiverses (and therefore the megaverse) with two different designations.

So how I see it is this. There exists the comics multiverse, and the movies multiverse. The comics one contains every comic, and the movie one contains the MCU, the Sonyverse, The Spider-verse (thanks to Venom's post credit scene), and  stuff removed from the canon like Agents of Shield.

However, the MCU exists in a crossroads of sorts. You can access it from the comics and the movies, but by different names. To the rest of the comics multiverse, it is Earth-199999. To the rest of the movies multiverse, it is Earth-616.

1657925033,Gooni135,I feel like the comic relief kinda killed Thor 4 (no spoiler),"Just want to say first that I liked the movie, it was...fine, but that's really it. Coming from Thor Ragnarok I expected a big comedic element but personally I would go as far as to say it was INCREDIBLY overdone. Not to say it wasn't funny but I feel like it took a lot of the attention away from the dark tone the film COULD have had. In simpler terms I feel like they treated this movie more like a comedy than a hero action movie. The point of comic relief is to act as a cushion for more serious sections of a movie, but there wasn't really much to take seriously. What sucks is that Christian Bale did a fanTANSTIC job, best villain we've seen since Thanos, and it's a shame that all that momentum he built up was kinda killed by certain weird jokes about hammers. I think if this film took on a little bit of a more serious tone it could've been much better. Something along the lines of how winter soldier felt. There were SOME jokes here and there but what drove the film was the plot and the action sequences and I really feel Thor 4 lacked in this area.

It seems like each series/movie reinvents the Multiverse idea for something different and none of it is tying together in any way.

Loki breaks the multi verse... Looks like that is the starting point... Then Spider Man NWH doesn't reference what happened there and does its own thing with the multiverse...

Loki breaks the multi verse... Looks like that is the starting point... Then Spider Man NWH doesn't reference what happened there and does its own thing with the multiverse...

So I'm looking for comics either featuring Dr Doom as the main character or where he just features prominently.

https://i.redd.it/jfk35avrlqb91.gif

***Hey all!*** 

***\[Before reading further, this depicts information about Wanda in MoM - if you have not seen the film or have not watched WandaVision do not proceed further unless you do not mind spoilers or have seen the series\]***

I wanted to share some thoughts in this community as I have re-watched Multiverse of Madness just a few times since its release (both in theaters, and a few times with a couple of different friend groups who have caught up on the newer Marvel storylines). I have been following the storylines for some time, I used to be into the comics when I was younger but did not follow every plot line - I mostly have read summaries and brief notes on basically what happens chronologically across the comic series in comparison to the movies. 

**- Wanda's progression through MCU Cinema Universe:** she is introduced as a ""mutant"" initially who gained her powers from the Mind Stone, then we see her involvement in Hyrda leading her/Pietro to temporarily band with Ultron against Tony Stark for vengeance (as Stark Technologies was responsible for the military technology/equipment used that inadvertently during a strike bombed and killed Maximoff's parents). We see her introduction in Age of Ultron - and the introduction of Vision/her becoming alliances with the Avengers when Pietro dies and she realizes Ultron's true plans for destruction. I think it's really important to consider that Wanda had lost everything prior to this time in her life - from her parents to Pietro, to then losing the Avengers. This brings me to a later point - but Natalya/Steve Rogers helped to train her and tried to help her control her powers, which of course brought about the unfortunate situation in the Civil War where her powers accidentally caused the death and explosion of a building while using her telekinesis to evade a bomber from harming people at ground level during a battle that Steve encountered during the beginning of the film. Wanda goes through a lot of trauma - from being orphaned, experimented on, seen as a monster publicly due to her powers, and then forced into hiding after the conflict from Civil War. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Wanda vs. Thanos (What If?):** it was very interesting to me that Wanda became undead in the ""What If?"" spin-off and they displayed different perspectives briefly of The Scarlet Witch from an undead type variant perspective/who was still very powerful against the Avengers as an enemy. This got me thinking though before even seeing Multiverse of Madness, but after seeing End Game - Wanda displayed a huge amount of power and threat against Thanos which became a noticeable feat amongst fans, Kevin Feige confirmed her power, amongst finally displaying some level of comic-Scarlet Witch power. Doctor Strange saw countless different realities in which they only defeated Thanos according to him, but ""What If"" this was not just the case - and Strange overlooked realities in which there were alternative points in time or blind spots overlooked in his visions where Wanda/The Scarlet Witch would be able to defeat him? I do want to caveat and say, of course for writing/movie purposes, the torch was passed to Tony Stark (Iron Man) who ended up carrying it out. This decision from Strange to hand Thanos the time stone did the following sequence of events:  


1. Wanda killed Vision in order to protect Thanos from getting 
2. Thanos reverses time (killing Vision ""meant nothing"" - according to Wanda in Multiverse of Madness) and kills Vision to steal the Mind Stone
3. Thanos kills half of the universe with a snap (including herself - who disappear for many years)
4. Tony Stark reverses time - but in doing so, Natalya dies while sacrificing herself for a stone, Captain America decides to join an alternative timeline after being introduced to the Multiversal concept of time/ages in the present day, and Tony Stark passes - leading to the end of the Avengers. Wanda ends up losing her friends, her love, and her safety due to this timeline.

Alternative timeline examples: Wanda faces Thanos earlier in Infinity War (possibly uses her powers to get the Gauntlet off of him or subdue him sooner), Wanda and Vision try to face Thanos in Wakanda, and/or Wanda releases her powers from WandaVision sooner (either from killing Vision or out of fear of Vision dying/protecting Vision) that she unlocks her power to shape reality - is able to use this to counteract his stones and subdue him to where Thor shows up and kills him\*

\--

**- WandaVision Events:** there's a lot of ongoing discussion and debate still on the actions of Wanda here, I have written past posts but I will summarize that she is a grey character (this matches her character arc). This storyline felt like a remix of The House of M Storyline (will not spoil that) but a take on Wanda losing her mind and her descent into becoming ""The Scarlet Witch"". I found the series very intriguing, nostalgic, very much a toy on the psyche, and makes you wonder the lengths you would go to if you knew you had the power to alter reality. Clearly here though, we see the mental instability of Wanda slowly slip and she becomes aggressive toward Vision, even her kids at some point in her neglect of being honest with them about the legitimate chaos ensued around them from her powers, and how she brainwashes the townspeople. I do empathize with her as we do see she does not realize her powers at first but then does catch on that it is intentional and she begins to bend the dark magic to her whim while trying to maintain self-preservation of her own interests in keeping Vision and her children. Agatha is also a grey character who we learn was not all bad - though she did introduce Wanda to the Darkhold (grave mistake - but very strange and I feel will come full circle as we need questions answered there as to why Agatha had it in the first place and why/if Wanda was so dangerous she would introduce her to the Darkhold). Overall - I loved Wandavision and the slow descent into madness for Wanda after years of build-up from the Marvel films, and it showed how well-developed Wanda's character has become. Wanda was the villain of her own story and while she made it ""right"" in the end - this was only because she was ""forced"" to once Vision became suspicious, the outside world was catching on, and Agatha confronted her as a fellow witch.   


***\*A very key observation here is similar to Shang Chi's Father as well*** for those who have seen the movie\* - where his Dad became corrupted by the rings and began to hear the voices of his wife calling for his help. At the end of Wandavision, we see Wanda with the Darkhold and she hears her children calling for help. I wonder if this will tie in with each other at some point but it did foreshadow the corruption we then see in Multiverse of Madness.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Multiverse of Madness, ""The Scarlet Witch"":** I actually very much enjoyed the take on Wanda's now full descent into becoming a villain. It was not the ""best"" Marvel movie in my opinion, but it very much felt like an ""Age of Ultron"" type in-between exposition film to help characters develop a built and fill in some new plot introductions about concepts for our main characters - also similar to ""Civil War"" in the sense that Strange and Wanda are having a very personal conflict. I understand in this case where Wanda is wrong - she has clearly become corrupted by the Darkhold and has knowingly abused her Chaos Magic after knowing the events of Wandavision she still took the Darkhold from Agatha and manipulated Dark Magic to try and take America's powers, and overall has become ruthless in her pursuit to enslave Chavez for her powers so she can essentially rule being able to become a Witch of Multiversal Travel - both to claim her sons and conquer any challenge through traveling the multiverse for endless solutions to problems. I know people felt upset or either did not see Wandavision (or have not watched all past Marvel films, or know of her comic-book character arc)  know this was not a random descent to madness or villainous for Wanda's character. I also appreciated the realism in her disdain for Strange, as I believe she learned a few things which the fans then end up becoming aware of or I think can become more aware of to consider:  


1. Maybe Strange's way to win the war against Thanos was not the only way to defeat him - meaning other realities possible where Vision lives/Wanda preserves her life with The Avengers
2. Strange never considered The Book of Vishanti (he even called it a hoax and myth at certain points where it ends up being revealed as true) - this could have been a deciding factor possibly in defeating Thanos from both timelines 
3. Strange ends up becoming corrupt in multiple realities - which Wanda learns, and is likely why she calls him a hypocrite, we learn he dream walks causing an incursion, dangles him with an opportunity to be with Christine for eternity as a trick to lure his desire for love/power (""Always holding the knife""), amongst other issues revealed that he essentially breaks Multiversal concepts - I am sure the events of No Way Home/Infinity War/End Game all combined to this moment have not helped.
4. ""The Scarlet Witch"" has learned that her powers may have been enough to defeat Thanos. Her disdain for Strange based solely on this is evident - you notice during the final scenes of ""End Game"" as Wanda is both grieving, you notice that the two magical beings never interact once. Looking back to this moment, I wonder how upset Wanda may have actually been with Strange's decision to sacrifice them all (including himself) and be the master of fate essentially which brought them to this moment where Wanda has lost everyone forever.
5. Strange continuously tells her the kids aren't real - this shows how much more developed she is in her knowledge of the Multiverse and magic in areas he is not strong in/but proceeds to claim he knows it all (i.e. ""Always holding the knife""). I understand where this angers her more as she finds him condescending and hypocritical based on his events from No Way Home, and also in his pursuits to determine the fate of the Infinity War/End Game wars at the whim of his ""This is the only way decision"", Wanda probably does not trust his judgment. This coupled with her corruption, and the Darkhold (similar to Shang Chi's father - calling for help and to be saved from demons) is likely why Wanda snaps - the magical corruption, the thirst to get her children back, the battle against those who mock her ""magical"" children who actually **do** exist, and she probably really is mentally convinced that the greater good for the multiverse is to steal Chavez's powers.
6. The moment we realize Wanda basically is considered a supernatural ""God-like"" being - where Chthon had created Wundagore, The Darkhold, gifted her basically with Chaos magic - she and the audience realize more that she had the potential to stop Thanos in our universe - as did other universes using other means of magic, such as The Book of Vishanti - which Strange kept Dreamwalking anyways in ""hopes"" to find a solution to defeating Thanos and though he never did, continued to use corrupt magic. The parallels between Wanda and Strange in the film I think are very well done and in fact show that no decisions made may have been finite in the scope of the Multiverse in terms of having ""1 way"" to kill Thanos - and it also shows the possibilities within both Strange as a grey character who may be as dangerous or similar to Wanda/The Scarlet Witch.
7. The ending of the movie - without delving too much into it, I will not say what I think the fate is of Wanda but I do think her variant will have consequences play out from needing to prove her innocence in that universe due to the destruction caused by The Scarlet Witch. I also do think ""House of Harkness"" will cover the aftermath of ""Multiverse of Madness"" while looking into Agatha's past as well, and I do feel as if Wanda's ""Death"" was actually a spell or some type of self-preserving prison to keep herself captive. This reminds me of a spin on something they did similar in the comic where Wanda exiles herself temporarily due to an event that happened.
8. This is why, to me, this is similar to Age of Ultron and Civil War where it's introducing a larger foe (possible Kang, Nightmare, etc) and now that Wanda is ""dead"" there is a possibility she can be controlled or taken advantage of.

Also just want to say - loved the whole vibe of the movie. I give it a solid 8/10 (it was like a B+ for me in terms of Marvel) - I loved the visuals, the music was great, and the ""Dream Walking"" explanation scene from Mordo is one of my favorite Marvel scenes I think now of all time. Overall a very fun movie.",1,"Wanda's State of Mind - Psyche in Multiverse of Madness [Possible Spoilers] &amp;#x200B;

I read Avengers (Aaron run) and appearently he is a villian there again and a very enjoyable one too, he is probably even better than he was before he sacrificed himself, i love his new attitude and laid back sarcasm.

One of them is a man named William Barracks who's a 16 to 18-year-old American volunteer that joined in 1916 and is a  forgotten legend that was the original Captain America before Steve Rogers who was considered the original during WW2. Now a few differences are his costume which has a sorta WW1 look with a sorta Bucky Barnes mask from the old comics, he doesn't have a shield yet he has the Star, and he later wears a new outfit in 2040 wearing a modified outfit with Captain America's shield.

It’s that the MCU is too different to be 616, let me elaborate. So earth 616 is supposed to be the prime dimension for marvel, all of the events happen in a very specific way and all of the characters are very specific people, I think that the MCU has strayed too far away from the source material to be that particular universe.

In earth 616 she is a redhead Caucasian girl and her name is Mary Jane Watson, in the MCU she is a lighskin black girl with the name Michelle Jones Watson. It would be one thing if they just changed what she looked like but they changed her whole name too, if this were the prime universe for marvel then she would look exactly how he does originally and she would have the same name. It’s not just her either, Taskmaster had the same problem, in the comics HIS name was Tony Masters and he was a mercenary, in the films it was Dreykov’s daughter with a name that kinda resembles the original name but not really. It would make more sense if these characters were from variant universes. The major marvel events such as civil war are too different from how they originally happened as well, I’m not saying that they should do the exact same thing but just in movie form, I’m just saying that this is a film adaptation of these characters and events so they should stay consistent with how these things transpired and who the characters are but at the same time adding their own spin on it to make it more interesting while not rewriting the whole story. I honestly don’t think that they should have made it earth 616, they should have just tried to make it it’s own universe, plus how cool would it have been if the REAL 616 was out there and it’s just like the comic universe or it IS the comic universe?

It would be one thing if they just changed what she looked like but they changed her whole name too, if this were the prime universe for marvel then she would look exactly how he does originally and she would have the same name. It’s not just her either, Taskmaster had the same problem, in the comics HIS name was Tony Masters and he was a mercenary, in the films it was Dreykov’s daughter with a name that kinda resembles the original name but not really. It would make more sense if these characters were from variant universes. The major marvel events such as civil war are too different from how they originally happened as well, I’m not saying that they should do the exact same thing but just in movie form, I’m just saying that this is a film adaptation of these characters and events so they should stay consistent with how these things transpired and who the characters are but at the same time adding their own spin on it to make it more interesting while not rewriting the whole story. I honestly don’t think that they should have made it earth 616, they should have just tried to make it it’s own universe, plus how cool would it have been if the REAL 616 was out there and it’s just like the comic universe or it IS the comic universe? That would have been so much cooler in my opinion."

The whole movie they made multiple references to afterlives for gods and even the god that Gor killed specifically mocked him for there not being an afterlife (which seemed to be a real trigger for him back then). This would play into helping Thor as it would allow Jane to pass on (I still don’t think she should be in Val Halla) and not force Gore’s daughter to live with a strange man and be a demigod mercenary when she clearly has been through a lot including starving to death.",1,"(Thor Spoilers)A slight change to the ending of Love &amp; Thunder….

1657790410,PM_ME_YOUR_STOMACHS,Controversial opinion: Focusing on the same ~30 characters is making the Marvel Universe boring.,"The Marvel Universe is big. Very big. Yet, just like Star Wars and the Skywalker family, almost all of the comic books that have been released in the 616 universe focus on the same characters (Iron Man, Spider-Man, Blade, etc). This causes the issues to feel like there just repeats of the same event that happened five years ago. Spider-Man and MJ argue for the 200th time. Iron Man must save the day without his armour for the 50th time. Wolverine stars in his 1 millionth issue, etc.

There is enough possible content at the moment to write about for decades, without touching the usual characters.

If every issue has around 32 pages, and each individual *page* featured one Krakoa mutant (assuming there’s 200,000 of them), then that’s 6,250 issues. 

When we get to the Arakko mutants, things get much more interesting. 4 million new mutants with exciting, unseen powers gets us up to 125,000 issues.

A decent writer could make a fantastic 6-issue comic for any of these characters. Meaning that there is a possibility of at least (4,000,000 + 200,000 x 6 = ) 25,200,000 comic books worth of content for just mutants alone.

That’s not even considering all the super-powered individuals who aren’t mutants. And that’s just *one planet*.

Instead of yet another Wolverine origin story, tell me a story of a civilian mutant trying to start a new life on Arakko, or a teenager discovering their new superpowers in a city that isn’t New York, like Rio de Janeiro, London, or Lagos. Hell, I’ll even take a 6-issue event around Paste-Pot Pete.

1657789199,kihu16,Very late to the party but just finished NWH and wanted to share my thoughts,"I did manage to avoid most spoilers up until now (aside from Andrew and Tobey) so idk how others feel about it. 

Overall, the movie was meh. I looked up ratings after and was pretty surprised to see how high they were. As far as cinema goes, it wasn't bad but the story is what ruined it for me. They pushed the ""good guy"" narrative way too far and it was beyond reason. Peter has done questionable things on an impulse in the past to try to be ""good"" and I get that it's part of his character, but putting the entire multiverse at risk to save a handful of bad guys? Knowing that even if you succeed there are infinite universes out there where they are still bad? Because May said so?? I just can't wrap my head around how doing that would be worth it no matter how much of a good guy you are. This also ruined May's character for me. The fact that before she dies she still says trying to help them was the right thing is just bs. 

Some other parts of the story were also very questionable. First, Wong? He showed up in the beginning, said keep me out of this, and that's it? You would think the actual sorcerer supreme would know or care a little more about the multiverse breaking. And then there's MJ. Went from a logical but skeptical person to immediately fully trusting Peter and not even questioning any of his actions. Especially the scene where she and Ned are watching the news after May dies and they're sitting there still wondering if they should push the button. I know it's all part of the story and it's what needs to happen but it's such a reach in terms of how the characters and normal people would react. Also, the scene where Peter traps Strange using math was extremely cringe. Yeah they're trying to show Peter combining his powers with his other skills but still... that was just bad. 

The last half of the movie, I'm going to be honest, I had to pause and have quite a few drinks before finishing. The writing was a little clunky but I think it fits kind of well with all 3 spider mans. The final fight was pretty boring and just as you'd expect. A typical hero team up where they struggle at some point but get it together in the end. However, I did really enjoy watching Peter (Tom) beat the crap out of Norman. It was such a powerful moment and one of the scenes that actually felt genuine and not just there to move the story along. 

Overall, I would've liked the movie much more had they not pushed the good guy narrative so hard. And I'm going to be bold and say that the only reason this movie is rated as well as it is, is because of the actors.

1657785948,TheIncredibleHarry,I have a unpopular opinion about Hulk that should be common knowledge.,"I’m tired of hearing this so here we go…Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk looks nothing like a ape. Hulk has the same facial features  
and bone anatomy as any human it’s just that his skull structure is proportionally exaggerated.

Yes Hulk’s brown ridge, chin, and upper lip are supposed to be over exaggerated. Hulk and Jack Kirby purposely made Hulk like this because they took some inspiration from Frankenstein’s for Hulk’s physical design.

Some people still say because of this he looks like an ape and well anatomically that’s STILL not true. The WHOLE skull of a gorilla differs from regular humans &amp; Hulk’s skull for so many reasons.

1). Gorillas have a large sagittal crest on the top of their skulls which give them the cone head appearance. Hulk doesn’t have a gorilla cone head lol Hulk’s skull shape is the same as a human just slightly sloped and the brown ridge is larger

2). Gorillas have proportionately big canine teeth but Hulk doesn’t. His teeth are usually portrayed as being proportionally smaller than regular humans in comparison to his overall face.

3). Gorillas have prognathism giving them a protruding face but Hulk doesn’t have that. His upper lip is longer than the average human’s but his face is still flat like a humans and doesn’t protrude extremely.

4). Gorillas have receding chins but Hulk’s chin is pronounced.

Anyway I digress, in the movie Mr. Fantastic tells Wanda, Black Bolt's only power that being his voice in which Wanda simply removes the hole in Black Bolt's face containing his mouth. Black Bolt freaks out and blows his own brains out but with a sound instead of a gun, Mr. Fantastic horrified by what Wanda did freaks out and tries to grab Wanda but she simply shreds him and turns him into cottage cheese.

Now as most people know Mr. Fantastic has been getting ""memeed on"" so to speak with there being memes calling him the dumbest man in the world or saying that he forgot that he is the smartest man alive. At first I didn't mind these memes as I thought that everyone was right and Mr. Fantastic made a dumb decision, which I'm not saying didn't make ***A*** dumb decision meaning one but I'm saying that the decision to tell Wanda about Black Bolt was only semi-dumb. You see for those of you who weren't really paying attention to the situation and just wanted a fight, Mr. Fantastic thought he could simply intimidate Wanda into surrendering. Being that he found Strange to be more dangerous than Wanda he though Wanda would be a walk in the park compared to Strange. So as an intimidation attempt he told Wanda what Black Bolt could do to Wanda, as we all know Wanda was not at all intimidated and took away Black Bolt's face hole making him blow up from the inside out.

Now where Mr. Fantastic makes the dumb decision is in what he does next, instead of being calm about the situation he freaks out and you can see it in his face as soon as Black Bolt dies. Reed looks like he just lost not only his best friend (which he did), but his most powerful ally (which he kind of did I mean Captain Marvel wasn't much help) and so decides he can maybe restrain Wanda but she sees it coming and kills him. Also I'm not saying you shouldn't be scared or sad when your friend is brutally murdered in front of you but I'm saying if you have bigger fish to fry (metaphorically speaking) then you should fry the fish then mourn. Also just because your the smartest man alive doesn't mean you don't sometimes make dumb decisions or just not have feelings, and remember feelings make us all act dumb sometimes.

Being that he found Strange to be more dangerous than Wanda he though Wanda would be a walk in the park compared to Strange. So as an intimidation attempt he told Wanda what Black Bolt could do to Wanda, as we all know Wanda was not at all intimidated and took away Black Bolt's face hole making him blow up from the inside out.

Now where Mr. Fantastic makes the dumb decision is in what he does next, instead of being calm about the situation he freaks out and you can see it in his face as soon as Black Bolt dies. Reed looks like he just lost not only his best friend (which he did), but his most powerful ally (which he kind of did I mean Captain Marvel wasn't much help) and so decides he can maybe restrain Wanda but she sees it coming and kills him. Also I'm not saying you shouldn't be scared or sad when your friend is brutally murdered in front of you but I'm saying if you have bigger fish to fry (metaphorically speaking) then you should fry the fish then mourn. Also just because your the smartest man alive doesn't mean you don't sometimes make dumb decisions or just not have feelings, and remember feelings make us all act dumb sometimes.

Anyway I'm glad I got that out of the way."

1657739347,EntertainmentBoy,Ms. Marvel show review [Spoilers],"So I just saw episode 6 of Ms. Marvel and here are my thoughts. 

It was great, even though there were some problems I thought this was the best episode of the season. Why weren't any of the other episodes as good as this one?

The action was top-notch, with good CGI on Ms. Marvel's powers and Kamran's powers.  Kamran's powers are soo beautiful and cool to look at, they are blue and soo comics accurate. He uses his powers almost like cosmic blasts. Kamala Khan's powers are the same, but in a different color, she uses them differently, almost like forming 
constructs, like Green Lantern, but not as complex. The way she uses them in the show is such a call back to her powers in the comics, she even says embiggen in this episode when she kicks ass using them to do awesome things. Ms. Marvel isn't comics-accurate though, I love all the Pakistani heritage and representation, she is a hero for that type of culture and it's great and comics-accurate. But in the show Bruno, who I love, he's such a great character. 

He says in the episode that Kamala is a mutant and that her powers are a mutation. That doesn't make any sense at all because just last episode they were talking about her being a Gin. This whole season, her heritage and powers were explained to us as a Gin. Kamala is a Gin who gets her powers from the Noor Dimension. But now in episode 6, she's a mutant. 

That means this whole show has just been a big waste of time! Marvel spent most of the time trying to fit Ms. Marvel into the cosmic world of the MCU saying that she's connected to Captain Marvel somehow in some way. When she is not, her powers seem more magic in the show. This adaptation hasn't been working out, so they call her a mutant now. It's so messed up, and very confusing, how is her powers a mutation if she gets it from the Noor dimension. She can't even use them without the bangle, and since she's a mutant does that mean her heritage is too like her great grandmother or Kamran's mother. Is Kamran a mutant too, because that also doesn't make sense. He has the same powers as Kamala. 

Mutants are born with their powers and they all have different abilities, not the same. Also, mutant powers aren't inherited either. Ms. Marvel can also shape-shift too, which I think is also from the comics, she shape-shifts into Captain Marvel in episode 6, what's up with that? This whole show overall has just been a big convoluted mess. Episodes 1,2 were great, episodes 3,4 were ok, and episodes 5,6 were the best of the season, but also just ruined Kamala khans character. I hope Captain Marvel 2 can explain her a little better than this show did. I also hope we get to see Bruno again, he's awesome. Also, the red dagger character is good too, I want to see him again. 

Her parents continue to be a great addition to her character. I loved that her mother made her superhero suit, she looked great. Her father also gave her, her superhero name with that amazing speech that made my heart smile. Damage control was soo bad, I was soo annoyed with them this whole season. So far to me, this is the fourth best Marvel Disneyplus show. It was good in some parts, but very confusing and not comics accurate, which has caused the story to suffer.  I usually don't care about marvel not being comics accurate, but when the story starts to suffer, because of the changes they made to a character that's when it's a big problem.",1,"Ms. Marvel show review [Spoilers] So I just saw episode 6 of Ms. Marvel and here are my thoughts.

1657717350,Ordinary_Schmuck,Quick Thoughts on Ms. Marvel (+Finale),"Alright, now for the season finale of *Ms. Marvel.* And it’s...not great.

Now, on paper, the idea of Kamala going out of her way to save a colored powered individual from a corrupt system of authority is a great one. And, at times, it kind of works. That is, it works when it’s Kamala and Kamran, with Kamala doing her own damage control (ha) against Kamran’s attempts to really hurt people. *That* results in some fun and tense action. When it comes to Kamala’s friends trying to mess with Damage Control like they’re meddling kids in an episode of *Scooby-Doo,* it’s a little too silly. Like, nothing that they’ve done should have worked.

But the main issue that “No Normal” has isn’t anything that happens in this episode. It’s everything that happened in the series that builds up to it. Kamran having powers isn’t really a bad idea, but how he got them involved this long and convoluted process that, when you sit down and think about it, doesn’t make much sense. It’s almost as if it would have been better if he had powers to begin with. Maybe through something like, I don’t know, through a terrigen gas bomb that gave random people in the city superpowers and forcing Kamala to deal with them? Something that happened in the comics? And that you could use future series/movies to explain why such an event happened in the first place?

Just a thought.

And, hey, if they *did* go the terrigen gas route, it would also do a great job in building up Damage Control as the final threat. They barely got any focus in this series, all because all the attention went to the schmucks who died in the previous episode. If we spent time with Sargent What’s-Her-Face, dealing with other powered individuals and being hostile to the ones that are “coincidentally” people of color, then we’d have a decent villain that makes for the perfect antagonist for Kamala, given both characters backgrounds. But, no, we needed to have this completely unnecessary story-line smooshed into the series just so we can establish why Ms. Marvel is powerful enough to be an Avenger. By the way, can we *please* stop this idea that a hero needs to save the world to establish why they should be an Avenger? It hurt *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,* it hurt *Moon Knight,* and it *destroyed Ms. Marvel.* A hero doesn’t need to save the world to prove that they’re worth being one of Earth’s mightiest heroes. Ant-Man, Spider-Man, and Black Panther’s solo movies were about them fighting villains who’s motivations were to give dangerous weapons to others. It’s not world ending, but it could still do a lot of damage to a lot of innocent people. And that’s fine.

Kamala didn’t need to fight these inter-dimensional beings who could potentially destroy everything in getting back home. Not when fighting Damage Control could be just as important and lead to an incredible message about a corrupt system in law enforcement. The world doesn’t need to be saved when helping a small number of people could do just as much good. After all...

“Whoever saves one person, it is as if he has saved all of mankind.”-Yusuf Khan. From the comics. Which do in fact matter.

As a whole, the finale’s a mess. Which makes sense because the *whole series* is a mess too.

As far as I can tell, *Ms. Marvel* nails the spirit of the character, [but it failed the most important aspect of her.](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/ordinaryschmuck/686229940763557888?source=share)

And I *do* love the characters (expect for the boring and forgettable villains). Hell, I’ve kept saying that the best parts of *Ms. Marvel* are the moments that make these characters feel human, especially the moments involving Kamala’s friends and family and the Muslim/Arabic heritage. If this was just a series about an over imaginative girl who learned to appreciate her heritage and the people around her, it’d get an easy A for effort. But it isn’t. It’s a superhero series that tries way too hard to be grand and epic when something small and personal would have fit much better.

So, as is, I’d say *Ms. Marvel’s* a...5/10? Maybe a 6/10 if I wanted to be nice?

I don’t know. Phase Four of the *MCU* really is a mess, and it’s evident that *Marvel Studios* are focusing more on quantity than quality. Nothing they’ve made is really *that bad,* but they definitely need to take a break, take a breath, and reconsider what fans want from this franchise.",1,"Quick Thoughts on Ms. Marvel (+Finale) Alright, now for the season finale of *Ms. Marvel.* And it’s...not great.

They barely got any focus in this series, all because all the attention went to the schmucks who died in the previous episode. If we spent time with Sargent What’s-Her-Face, dealing with other powered individuals and being hostile to the ones that are “coincidentally” people of color, then we’d have a decent villain that makes for the perfect antagonist for Kamala, given both characters backgrounds. But, no, we needed to have this completely unnecessary story-line smooshed into the series just so we can establish why Ms. Marvel is powerful enough to be an Avenger. By the way, can we *please* stop this idea that a hero needs to save the world to establish why they should be an Avenger? It hurt *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,* it hurt *Moon Knight,* and it *destroyed Ms. Marvel.* A hero doesn’t need to save the world to prove that they’re worth being one of Earth’s mightiest heroes. Ant-Man, Spider-Man, and Black Panther’s solo movies were about them fighting villains who’s motivations were to give dangerous weapons to others. It’s not world ending, but it could still do a lot of damage to a lot of innocent people. And that’s fine.

Kamala didn’t need to fight these inter-dimensional beings who could potentially destroy everything in getting back home. Not when fighting Damage Control could be just as important and lead to an incredible message about a corrupt system in law enforcement. The world doesn’t need to be saved when helping a small number of people could do just as much good. After all...

“Whoever saves one person, it is as if he has saved all of mankind.”-Yusuf Khan. From the comics. Which do in fact matter.

As a whole, the finale’s a mess. Which makes sense because the *whole series* is a mess too.

As far as I can tell, *Ms. Marvel* nails the spirit of the character, [but it failed the most important aspect of her.](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/ordinaryschmuck/686229940763557888?source=share)

And I *do* love the characters (expect for the boring and forgettable villains). Hell, I’ve kept saying that the best parts of *Ms. Marvel* are the moments that make these characters feel human, especially the moments involving Kamala’s friends and family and the Muslim/Arabic heritage. If this was just a series about an over imaginative girl who learned to appreciate her heritage and the people around her, it’d get an easy A for effort. But it isn’t. It’s a superhero series that tries way too hard to be grand and epic when something small and personal would have fit much better.

So, as is, I’d say *Ms. Marvel’s* a...5/10? Maybe a 6/10 if I wanted to be nice?

I don’t know. Phase Four of the *MCU* really is a mess, and it’s evident that *Marvel Studios* are focusing more on quantity than quality. Nothing they’ve made is really *that bad,* but they definitely need to take a break, take a breath, and reconsider what fans want from this franchise."

Mighty Thor - I understand that Jane Foster is mortal but can transform into Mighty Thor, which makes her worthy of wielding Mjolnir and that using Mjolnir drains her mortal character’s energy.

What I don’t understand is why are they both called Thor or more importantly, why doesn’t Jane Foster have her own Asgardian name for when she turns into her superhero version? I thought Thor was a single person whereas now it seems to be more of a type of character from Asgard who can wield certain weapons like Mjolnir and Stormbreaker.

Then we have Jed Mackay consistently knocking it out of the park with Moon Knight, Strange and, most surprisingly, Iron Cat (though that's only a surprise for those who haven't read his Black Cat series, because the guy writes the best Felicia).

Captain America by Kelly and Lanzig is just starting but already feels like the best Cap run since Brubaker. Steve's voice in this is perfect, and there's an almost Hickman-esque vibe to the complex plot. 

What else? Venom is excellent when Ewing is writing (Ewing never misses x 2), and Ram V's Carnage is a real nice neo-noir crime story meets cosmic horror. And speaking of horror, Percy's Ghost Rider is one of the best horror comics on stands these days. 

I dropped Cates' godawful Thor ongoing, but Gronbekk's Jane Foster and the Mighty Thor is giving me the epic, mythology-driven Thor series I wanted. Shame it's just a mini.

1657616904,Kordben,Lately the Black Cat has became the best written character within MARVEL comics.,"I'm a long time Spider-Man fan and felt really sad when they made Felicia the new Kingpin (Queenpin) because it was horrible writing all over the place after Superior Spider-Man. She was always a thief and an anti hero and one of Peter Parker's closest friend. Making her act the way she did during that time period was really inconsistent to her core personality and standards she set for herself.

That is why it was so heartwarming to see how the ASM Vol5. (ASM 2018) reestabilished her position within the universe.

*Processing img 1ij763n413b91...*

From this moment Felicia played crucial part (again) in every major spidey event during the run of the series in one way or another. 

Important to mention here that during Hunted event we get to see how she processing the fact that she can remember that Peter Parker is Spider-Man and everything that comes with it. It was unusual read because I rarely seen the character going so deep with her own emotions, or just overall in MARVEL comics it's not usual for side characters but I'm glad it happened and we get to see what is happening to her during this time.

*Processing img 96gk120k13b91...*

The issue was really good to read to see what is happening and how she tries to get over it. It must be difficult to realise that you was in a relationship with a guy years ago then it keep happening all over again and it's all like yesterday. As I said writers did an amazing job to reestabilish her and Pete's frienldy relationship and they did an amazing job doing so meanwhile laying the foundations to her ongoing series (12 issue in 2019 and a relaunch in 2020).

If you did not read it I sincerely advise to do so because it's really fun and engaging series. (art style is so much better during relaunch but the first series also had a charm). Dr. Strange, Fantastoc Four and many more are on her list.

[ Black Cat Vol1. #9 ](https://preview.redd.it/z109tecj23b91.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9af12afeb58b3e0e4fba7eb3e68f67b28fd7cf2)

The 2 series shown how **vulnerable, thoughtful, sassy, resourceful and brave** she can be and not just because we never seen these sides of her character explored by this much. Exploring her relationship with her master, the Black Fox and her gang is fun while also we are getting to know more about her past which is further explored in the current ongoing run, The Iron Cat.

Elegant, deep, action packed, has lot's of heart and many other words that are barely enough to describe how Black Cat was reestabilished in the past 2 years as one of the best written character in the market you could find while making Felicia Hardy the most fleshed out hero lately.

**Felicia Hardy is a much more fleshed out character right now than ever before and easily outshines many mainstream characters that has way bigger fanbase and story to work with.**

Her books are usually those gems readers like me are looking for.

During her run in 2019 we can see her hanging out occasionally with her Mother and seeing her face with Odessa, a former love interest. It helps us to understand Felicia and her family, surroundings more.   
The following relaucnh in 2020 ties into the ongoing event so she has a job to free Dr. Strange from the prison Knull, the King in Black. 

[Black Cat V2. #1](https://preview.redd.it/cxinn9dr53b91.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0bf6aad4f6ed0e2577001ec22c0e414b2947530)

We can see her succeeding and she did helps Dr. Strange escape from Knull's prison to help turn the tides in the war while also managed to overcame the extradimensional powers that the Asgardian Magic offered her (thanks to the fact that she do not desire to control and mnipulate others the way she would be able with the  magic). 

[Black Cat V2. #3](https://preview.redd.it/o6w5wii263b91.png?width=1303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a66b12f14c410a07917e08a3172ff1158f9645b)

As closorue the the first series we get to see how it's ending following the King in Black tie in. What Felicia has to do is basically a choice. Her mentor who raised and trained her seeks immortality thus makes a deal with a demon to gain immortality. All he has to offer to the demon is Manhattan. This is where the Black Cat has to make the ultimate choice of her life

[ Black cat Vol 2. #6 Felicia sacrifices the man she owes her life to save Manhattan and everyone within it.](https://preview.redd.it/xqhizmq183b91.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28dcf6548778042632d9fbb11b29c8f48985003b)

What follows as the last arc of the series is the biggest job she has ever taken. During teh arc she managed to outsmart Nick Fury Jr. more than once while having action packed sceens when the stakes are higher for her than ever before. Having her trying to collect the Infinity Gems bound individuals is no small job at all while she will have to deal with both Fury and Nighthawk (Batman). She manages to win at the end obviously and reaching her goal with those people while getting out alive from the actions.

After the series ended Villa joins MacKay on art continuing their crushingly good Black Cat  storytelling for a one-shot Mary jane &amp; Black Cat issue tying into the last arc of the previously mentioned SPider-Man arc ""Beyond"".

What unfolds in this issue is a fun team-up between Mary Jane and Black  Cat. The utter joy of this issue lies in the fact that these two aren’t  jealous of one another or played against each other. Instead, they are  working together to ensure Peter doesn’t get hurt while also bonding  along the way. In fact, there’s a rather touching final scene between  the two that establishes their mutual respect, how Mary Jane has dealt  with competing with other girls, and a strong sense of understanding of  each character. 

*Processing img 9aly8j8pa3b91...*

MacKay writes both characters in a natural and realistic way. He also  never puts Mary Jane in a position that’s too outlandish for someone who  isn’t a superhero. The plot moves along quickly with lots of surprises,  nods to Spidey villains, and more. It’s packed with content.  

ASM #87 written also by Jed MacKay puts heavy focus on the rehabilitation of Peter by his friends Steve Rogers and Felicia Hardy. MacKay has a firm grasp on Peter’s dynamic with both Felicia and Cap;  the former cares for him enough to know that he can’t suit up as Spidey  again without relearning his web-slinging ways, while the latter’s  worked side by side with him as an Avenger and knows how to push him  when needed.   
Both Peter and Felicia have been able to move more into being great friends that each can turn to since they know both their superhero and  personal identities on a different level than others in their respective lives. Understanding both sides of Peter, Felicia showed she understood that Peter can’t be his same reckless guy by just going back to being Spider-Man like he would normally after recovering enough from such an injury. 

I honestly have high hopes that she will be important character of the Spider-Man series as well having a blast already with her new ongoing series, The Iron Cat where she teams up with Tony Stark against a returning individual fromFelicia's past.

Jed MacKay has revitalized the Black Cat character and elevated her to new heights. With Iron Cat we will see her shine once again and I do hope that new Spider-Man run will be able to use her newfound directions and popularity. Who knows what the future brings to her. She can show up in the next Spider-Man game too and fans pretty much want's to see her in the next Spider-Man movie.",1,"Lately the Black Cat has became the best written character within MARVEL comics.

We can see her succeeding and she did helps Dr. Strange escape from Knull's prison to help turn the tides in the war while also managed to overcame the extradimensional powers that the Asgardian Magic offered her (thanks to the fact that she do not desire to control and mnipulate others the way she would be able with the  magic).

As closorue the the first series we get to see how it's ending following the King in Black tie in. What Felicia has to do is basically a choice. Her mentor who raised and trained her seeks immortality thus makes a deal with a demon to gain immortality. All he has to offer to the demon is Manhattan. This is where the Black Cat has to make the ultimate choice of her life

[ Black cat Vol 2. #6 Felicia sacrifices the man she owes her life to save Manhattan and everyone within it.](https://preview.redd.it/xqhizmq183b91.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28dcf6548778042632d9fbb11b29c8f48985003b)

What follows as the last arc of the series is the biggest job she has ever taken. During teh arc she managed to outsmart Nick Fury Jr. more than once while having action packed sceens when the stakes are higher for her than ever before. Having her trying to collect the Infinity Gems bound individuals is no small job at all while she will have to deal with both Fury and Nighthawk (Batman). She manages to win at the end obviously and reaching her goal with those people while getting out alive from the actions.

After the series ended Villa joins MacKay on art continuing their crushingly good Black Cat  storytelling for a one-shot Mary jane &amp; Black Cat issue tying into the last arc of the previously mentioned SPider-Man arc ""Beyond"".

What unfolds in this issue is a fun team-up between Mary Jane and Black  Cat. The utter joy of this issue lies in the fact that these two aren’t  jealous of one another or played against each other. Instead, they are  working together to ensure Peter doesn’t get hurt while also bonding  along the way. In fact, there’s a rather touching final scene between  the two that establishes their mutual respect, how Mary Jane has dealt  with competing with other girls, and a strong sense of understanding of  each character. 

*Processing img 9aly8j8pa3b91...*

MacKay writes both characters in a natural and realistic way. He also  never puts Mary Jane in a position that’s too outlandish for someone who  isn’t a superhero. The plot moves along quickly with lots of surprises,  nods to Spidey villains, and more. It’s packed with content.  

ASM #87 written also by Jed MacKay puts heavy focus on the rehabilitation of Peter by his friends Steve Rogers and Felicia Hardy. MacKay has a firm grasp on Peter’s dynamic with both Felicia and Cap;  the former cares for him enough to know that he can’t suit up as Spidey  again without relearning his web-slinging ways, while the latter’s  worked side by side with him as an Avenger and knows how to push him  when needed.   
Both Peter and Felicia have been able to move more into being great friends that each can turn to since they know both their superhero and  personal identities on a different level than others in their respective lives. Understanding both sides of Peter, Felicia showed she understood that Peter can’t be his same reckless guy by just going back to being Spider-Man like he would normally after recovering enough from such an injury. 

I honestly have high hopes that she will be important character of the Spider-Man series as well having a blast already with her new ongoing series, The Iron Cat where she teams up with Tony Stark against a returning individual fromFelicia's past.

Jed MacKay has revitalized the Black Cat character and elevated her to new heights. With Iron Cat we will see her shine once again and I do hope that new Spider-Man run will be able to use her newfound directions and popularity. Who knows what the future brings to her. She can show up in the next Spider-Man game too and fans pretty much want's to see her in the next Spider-Man movie."

1657566704,Antman269,Theory: The MCU is a franchise within the comics universe.,"Watching The Boys gave me an idea. 

It was established in Multiverse of Madness that the main MCU is Earth-616, meaning it is part of its own multiverse and it has no relation to the comics. 

America Chavez’s existence basically confirms this since there is supposed to only be one of her, and yet there is both a movie and comics version.

In The Boys, there are movies based on all of the superheroes that are clearly not accurate to what really happened.

In my theory, the MCU is a franchise of movies and shows created in the actual 616 comics universe. The X-Men franchise and other non-MCU Marvel movies were other attempts from different studios to adapt all the characters, but the MCU is the most successful one, even though it is not very faithful to how events really happened in the comics (Which is real life to them)

It would also be made a decade or two in the future from where the Marvel comics universe is now to explain how filmmakers know things that they shouldn’t, such as Spider-Man’s identity, since it is very much possible that people eventually learn of these things.

It would be like all those bio-pics about real people that get made in real life, but not very faithful to what really happened.

The concept and the build up was amazing. Every scene with Gorr in it was amazing and frightful at the same time. 

I will say it: Gorr's build up and execution as a charavter portrayed by Christan Bale was phenomenal. The best villain of MCU so far.

But every other scene in the movie with the slightest of funs, jokes and frivolous approach did no good to the movie but harmed it. Why is it so difficult to create a movie in MCU where people try to act somewhat serious in most of the time.

It's not juts children who watch the movie and even they can accept if the stakes are extremely high.  
Just look at Infinity War and Endgame. Movies were high rated for numerous reasons for a reason and it's not the blatant, forced humor and jokes that makes the movie look worse than what it is.

I had the same feeling with Multiverse of Madness. Tony Stark was the snarky figure who always shot jokes on point and this type of personality isn't exactly fittting for Dr. Strange but luckily it wasn't as much as it was in Thor yet the movie was still weak and mostly was carried by the fantastic Elizabeth Olsen who played her role extremely well and the ymanaged to make her really terrific.

The same goes for Love and Thunder. When you see Gorr you are watching an amazing movie.  
Natalie Portman's role was also great but they could have used her better (less childish and more serious after knowing what is goin on with her).

I do not want to complain because the Movie was fine, it wasn't bad but for fucks sake please reduce the amount humor and joke and childish element you out into these movies.

1657525676,inklingboi08,Fun fact: The Japanese Spider-Man series led to the creation of Power Rangers.,"Under a 4 year licensing deal with Toei Company (yes, THAT Toei, who's animation company makes such greats as Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and One Piece), the next series they produced following Supaidaman was Battle Fever J. It is now known as the 3rd Super Sentai series, but back then it was considered the first, ignoring the creations of Shotaro Ishinomori that were Himitsu Sentai Goranger and JAKQ Dengekitai due to licensing rights. Shotaro Ishinomori also created Kamen Rider, a sister series to Super Sentai, both of which continue to this day and are part of a genre called tokusatsu, which not only includes superhero productions but kaiju movies such as Godzilla and Gamera. Battle Fever J was also the first Sentai series to feature a giant robo/mecha, or what we in the west know as a Zord/Megazord. With the success of Battle Fever J and the other Marvel produced shows Denshi Senttai Denjiman and Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan, the Super Sentai franchise was able to continue as it does to this day. Haim Saban, while in Japan on a business trip, spotted the 8th (6th at the time) Super Sentai series, Choudenshi Bioman, on TV. He was like, ""I can make money off of this by dubbing it over!"" and so, 7 years later, in 1992, filming for the American segments of the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers began, taking stock footage from the 16th (14th at the time) Super Sentai series, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger. Fun fact, Stan Lee also saw a Sentai series whilst in Japan one time, but when he brought it to the network they turned it down. So somewhere in this ever expanding multiverse there's a world where Stan Lee created Power Rangers and it was created way before the 90s. Anyway, the suits stuck for the next two seasons, with the only elements they took from the consecutive Sentai being the mecha from Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger for seasons 2 and 3 respectively as well as the white ranger suit coming from Dairanger. The Alien Rangers of Aquitar were also adapted from the Kakurangers. For the most part, Power Rangers has continued to adapt from Sentai, although not entirely in order and jumping around a bit in recent years.

TL;DR: The Japanese Spider-Man series was part of a licensing deal with marvel that sparked 3 Super Sentai seasons, which helped boost the already rapidly growing popularity so much that Haim Saban saw it in Japan, and 7 years later took footage from these series (legally of course) to dub over and create Power Rangers.",1,"Fun fact: The Japanese Spider-Man series led to the creation of Power Rangers. Under a 4 year licensing deal with Toei Company (yes, THAT Toei, who's animation company makes such greats as Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and One Piece), the next series they produced following Supaidaman was Battle Fever J. It is now known as the 3rd Super Sentai series, but back then it was considered the first, ignoring the creations of Shotaro Ishinomori that were Himitsu Sentai Goranger and JAKQ Dengekitai due to licensing rights. Shotaro Ishinomori also created Kamen Rider, a sister series to Super Sentai, both of which continue to this day and are part of a genre called tokusatsu, which not only includes superhero productions but kaiju movies such as Godzilla and Gamera. Battle Fever J was also the first Sentai series to feature a giant robo/mecha, or what we in the west know as a Zord/Megazord. With the success of Battle Fever J and the other Marvel produced shows Denshi Senttai Denjiman and Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan, the Super Sentai franchise was able to continue as it does to this day. Haim Saban, while in Japan on a business trip, spotted the 8th (6th at the time) Super Sentai series, Choudenshi Bioman, on TV. He was like, ""I can make money off of this by dubbing it over!"" and so, 7 years later, in 1992, filming for the American segments of the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers began, taking stock footage from the 16th (14th at the time) Super Sentai series, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger. Fun fact, Stan Lee also saw a Sentai series whilst in Japan one time, but when he brought it to the network they turned it down.

1657516652,Blackbird2285,Is The Boys really better than Marvel?,"TLDR: Marvel is in dire need of mature content!

I've been seeing quite a bit of discussion around this particular topic of late. I personally think the Marvel multiverse as a whole is better, but I can absolutely see why people would prefer The Boys over Marvel. In fact, I'll go as far as to say that The Boys seasons one through three are better than most Marvel content. Of course, ""which is better"" is simply opinion and there is no wrong answer. 

However, one thing I think we can all agree on is that The Boys highlights a massive problem in the MCU: no real mature content. They did a damn fine job of making it work for phase 1-3, and I commend them for that. However, those of us that have been around since the first Iron Man in 08 are now in our 30's and 40's. We simply don't want a strict limit of PG or PG-13. We're grown ass adults. I get that they're trying to appeal to the younger generation to perpetuate the Marvel brand, but as a loyal fan I'm feeling a bit abandoned. I'm not saying everything Marvel has to be R rated, but please throw us a friggin bone Marvel! This problem is only going to get worse as time goes on. Deadpool remaining R rated for the next sequel is great, but it's not enough.",1,"Is The Boys really better than Marvel? TLDR: Marvel is in dire need of mature content!

Venom himself is well done in this movie, as far as the design, his dialogue and personality, and the action stuff, but there is no fleshing out his relationship with Eddie at all, in one scene they are not totally getting along but two scenes later they are totally cool

The dialogue overall in this.....HORRIBLE. I mean it seems like the script barely got two drafts in before they starting filming, I mean the writing is just cringey af and hardly feels like how people actually talk, and the delivery of all this dialogue...bad man.

Carlton Drake also sucks as a villain. He is not scary.....at all. I mean it's the crap writing and Riz Ahmed is the least intimidating actor they could have possibly found. Plus he is experimenting on homeless people...that alone does not make sense, I mean homeless ppl are not exactly the healthiest and nourished people on the planet...my point is these ppl are malnourished and he keeps wondering why the subjects keep failing, but whatever

1657473848,Eupatorus,Why does Marvel seem to be squandering their Warhammer 40k license?,"I was intrigued when Marvel took over the license for the WH40k universe a couple of years ago. I assumed they would make a real push for it in the way that they do with Star Wars and to a lesser degree the Alien/Predator franchise (which they acquired around the same time if I recall correctly). Star Wars is a juggernaut of course, but Alien and Predator are probably on par with WH40k as far as fandom/popularity goes and they are getting plenty of titles.

Yet so far there's only been two short mini-series (*Marneus Calgar* and *Sisters of Battle*) in two years. Both were pretty decent (I enjoyed them anyway) and I keep checking previews for more 40k titles but they aren't happening.

What's the deal? 40K has a rich, lore heavy universe that just seems ripe to be explored and fleshed out in comics. It's got a built in fan base in the people that play the tabletop game (I used to for many years, no time anymore) and even more fans that just play the various video games.

I just assumed when Marvel acquired the rights that they were going to run with it and really build up a Marvel 40k comics universe in the way that's never been done before, or *at least* do a mini-series for each of the different armies/factions. So far though, practically nothing!

Does anyone have any news or insight on why Marvel just acquired the license but is now just sitting on it? Why would they bother? Is there something I don't know going on? Simply abandoned for low sales? Did I miss something?

I know and understand that they are all connected together in the same Marvel Universe but I think the writers need to tone it down a notch or else it would diminish the main focus and the spot light of the super hero and would then be overshadowed by another MCU super hero that has no relevance to the plot.",1,"Including other MCU characters in a main super hero film ruins the movie ( Spoilers ) The one main and little concern that I have with the MCU franchise and with all the movies is when each of the film titles with these super hero movies that are specifically supposed to be about their own story &amp; background had to include other cameo appearances of other MCU characters outside of the respective Marvel Super hero's property.

So this limited 24 issue comic was absolutely perfect, it went in detail in a chronological order of everything that happen up until around 1968ish. I like they took actual panels from comics, it was like reading the first 40 issues/10 years without the unnecessary filler.

Is there anything similar I can read or maybe youtube summary videos I can watch to give me that same feel/updates? I've tried reading the 2012 and 2019 marvel histories but they seem so crammed ""yeah this happened, anyway moving to this other thing"" rather than telling a story.

1657427753,Dayvedscrap,Saw Thor: Love and Thunder (spoilers),"I know the movie was supposed to be more comedic so I’ll avoid commenting about the actual content of how it was portrayed. What I’m going to take issue with is some of the plot holes that presented themselves. I’ll attach a spoiler tag, but allow me to also provide another spoiler warning.

Jane using Mjolnir: 
I’m fine with her using Mjolnir to become “A Thor”, but the fact that she uses a broken Mjolnir at all raises some questions. The pieces “called” to her and the movie itself admitted that the pieces were immovable. This means that they maintained the enchantment to only be moved by the worthy (which is explained away by Thor having Mjolnir “protect her”). My issue stands with that she can move and operate the hammer as if it never were destroyed (with the exception of being able to break it apart on command). Thor then is able to lift the hammer in its reassembled state, so when Hela destroyed it why did he act like his weapon was gone forever? The pieces were right there, clearly still enchanted, and able to be reformed and wielded by him. Did the hammer decide it didn’t like Thor anymore? He had to forge Stormbreaker because his hammer was broken, but Jane was able to just pick up the pieces and use them, why didn’t he? Did he just decide that the hammer wasn’t worth using anymore?

Wish granting Eternity: 
The movie establishes that Thor knows that Eternity exists, heck even Valkyrie knew about it. Granted you need the Bifrost to get there, so Thor wouldn’t have been able to access Eternity until the end of Infinity War, but directly after the Snap Thanos destroys the Infinity Stones and retires. Thor shows up and pops his head off, all well and good, wouldn’t this be the perfect time to go and wish everyone back? The stones are gone, Thanos is dead, there is apparently no one guarding Eternity (Unless Gorr killed the guards off-screen, which even if he did I’m sure the remaining heroes post-snap could probably handle any resistance) Thor could go in and wish everyone back, wish Thanos never snapped, or really any number of counter wishes. Instead Thor waits 5 years because he…forgot? He didn’t feel like it? Would rather partake in time travel shenanigans?

Thor can grant Thor powers:
I was under the impression that Jane was using Mjolnir as the source of her “Thor power”, but apparently Thor can just grant his powers to anyone? Not even a single person either, he can grant his powers to just over a dozen children. He did specify that it was temporary, but it felt like it was because he didn’t want super powered kids running around, not out of lack of ability to give them permanently. Was Thor only able to do this because he held the bolt? How did he know the bolt could do this? Why did the bolt work for him at all? You would think someone like Zeus would have a similar “worthy” enchantment on his greatest weapon, or at the very least a “only function for me” enchantment. So I’ll assume Thor can just hand these abilities out willy nilly, I know shooter mcpokeysticks and redhead twistythighs would certainly benefit from some Thor power. Even if he can only do it temporarily, why not give everyone a Thor boost before battle?

I have other issues, but these three seemed like the largest glaring problems that contradict other lore already set up by the other movies. I’m curious what you folks think or if you have theories on how/why these plot holes actually work.

So with Disney+ becoming a streaming service the dynamic of the MCU has forever changed. Disney+ is trying to compete with other streaming services like Netflix and the only way to compete is to push out new content which leads to new subscribers. The Disney+ content is coming like tsunamis. 

As you are seeing with Netflix, after a certain point the content is just not as good because of dilution. And for other reasons as well. With Netflix there are so many shows and movies but rare Ozarks or Stranger Things. With the *MCU*, Disney+ is going to pump Agatha and other shows to keep the subscribe count up. They certainly can afford to. Some shows may hit or miss, but they will exist whether you like it or not. 

So picture Netflix, except all their Netflix original shows and movies are connected. With some exceptions, but I personally dont like to blend characters from shows to movies with the exception of cameos. 

For example Wandavision is connected to DS: MoM. Ms. Marvel is connected to The Marvels. The Disney+ shows are now a pipeline to the movies. This leads to occasional forms of dilution. Was it really Doctor Strange’s sequel? Similar to Captain America 3, except now incorporate Disney+ content as well. I personally think there should be boundaries between Disney+ and MCU movies. Only time will tell. So yeah Disney+ is a streaming service and cash rules everything around MCU.",1,"The MCU has changed forever since the release of Disney+

WandaVision - Origin of The MCU Scarlett Witch, SWORD/that one sword agent guy are made out to be the villains,
Agatha is revealed to be the real villain and uses magic.

Falcon and the Winter Soldier - Origin of the new Captain America, Karli is the proposed villain with a bunch of goons who have the super soldier serum like bucky (captain america’s sidekick), the Sharon Carter is revealed to be the real big bad!

Hawkeye - origin of the new Hawkeye, Jack, an equally if not better swordsman and Echo(i forget her name) are the proposed villains, it is revealed Kates mom is working for kingpin and is the real villain whos been pulling strings!

Moonknight - origin of the MCU Moonknight, harrow is the villain, but really hes just (trying to become) the avatar to a different god like Mark/Steven/Jake, oh my gosh!!! Its revealed Khonshu is manipulating him and is a bad guy!!! Woahhhhh

Now this is what really upsets me

MS MARVEL. Fuck man, ive loved this show, totally thought people have been taking it too seriously.

But this god damn last episode “kamran” *dies* and HE GETS THE SAME FUCKING POWERS AS KAMALA. Fuck me. For once FOR FUCKING ONCE, MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL. 

Loki was originalish but in my opinion the show was a trash heap, weird poorly done Bi representation, poor acting in spots, they still did the stupid ass secret villain thing (that weird council then OOP nvm its just kang). Theres that really weird thing with loki wanting to fuck himself from another universe then to having spider-man consider his variants brothers.

Im just so tired of it all. I love the movies more than almost anything but for the love of god Disney Marvel couldnt make a decent show if its entire existence depended on it.

- foggy and Karen in the first 3 episodes then disappear into the background of the season
- Echo is proposed to be the villain
-Echo kicks the shit out of daredevil

1657414741,DoomTyr,IMO Iron Man and Spider-Man have a somewhat toxic relationship in the MCU.,"I have multiple reasons as to why I think this. When they first met in Civil War Peter is starstruck at meeting his hero and Tony takes him to his room to have a chat on him being Spider-Man and needing his help. Peter didn't want to go until Tony decided to blackmail him by telling his Aunt May everything if he didn't come, forcing him to go to protect his identity. He is then bribed with a fancy hotel room and a new suit for Peter to use in the fight clouding Peter's judgment on the whole thing. I'm assuming he didn't really tell Peter the whole story with the accords, which goes against many things Spider-Man is, and only that Captain America went rogue. So bringing Peter, a literal fourteen year old, into a battle between the Avengers isn't something any sane adult would do. Even if they are stronger than most of the heroes there.

Onto Homecoming, Peter is dropped off back at his apartment where two months go by with both Happy and Tony ignoring him. During that time Peter was doing his Spider-Man gig like always until he discovered the Vulture and his alien tech. Is rescued by Iron Man from drowning and the two have a talk on Peter taking on this guy. Tony says this kind of stuff was below their pay grade which is something Spider-Man would never excuse after Uncle Ben. He also happens to mention the voice mails Peter leaves them. So he has the time to listen to whatever Peter sends but can't send any kind of reply back?

It's then shown Tony isn't in the suit but somewhere else at a fancy gathering and not much worried about the Vulture situation. Fast forward sometime and Ned hacks into the multimillion dollar suit built by Tony Stark himself allowing Peter to use all kinds of features he didn't know about. One of those features happen to be an instant kill mode. Why would Tony give a teenager an easier way to kill someone, and an easy way for them to hack to use it?

Later Spider-Man is at the ferry putting a stop to a weapons deal of Vultures when the FBI get a jump on him and the criminals allowing Adrian to run off to suit up. Ferry gets sliced in half and Iron Man comes to save the day. He then meets Peter again blaming him for the whole incident and telling him he was the one that put the FBI on it, telling Peter everyone thought he was crazy bringing in a fourteen year old to fight.

Firstly Peter can't be fully blamed for this as Tony failed to inform him the FBI would be involved. Secondly, why would Tony involve the FBI, there's no way they were trained to deal with criminals using alien tech because Vulture is the one to capitalize on it. Peter was much more aware on what kind of danger he was facing and almost took down the operation if the FBI didn't intervene. Thirdly, did Tony tell other people who Spider-Man is? We know Happy and Pepper did but who else? Who else in higher power can put Peter in danger if his secret got out.

Tony then wants the suit back with Peter saying he was nothing without it, having the idea forced in his head he wouldn't be good enough because of Tony. He was already Spider-Man for six months before he met Tony and two months with the the suit which wasn't any much different from his old one till he hacked it. He was Spider-Man, not Tony. To rub in some salt he makes Peter walk home in dirty pajamas from a garage bin or else he would have had to journey home in his underwear. Couldn't have used some of your billions of dollars to by some decent clothes for him to go home in?

Peter feels like crap and blames himself because his hero dumped all the guilt onto him. At the end Peter is picking up by Happy, who admitted his wrong doings and forever grateful to Peter finally giving him respect he should've given in the first place. Tony takes some credit in Peter taking down the Vulture saying it was a good lesson for him. Was the lesson that he didn't need your suit to stop him? Tony then bribes him again with a better suit similar to his and a spot on the Avengers, which that make him have to sign the accords? Has Tony been breaking the law still by ignoring the accords for Spider-Man?

Thankfully he rejects wanting to focus on the little as he lost sight of that to focused on becoming an Avenger with his hero. He goes home to find the suit in a bag on his bed, Tony still somewhat bribing Peter. And did he break into his home to put it there?

Between the events of Homecoming and Infinity War I honestly don't think Peter and Tony hung out as much as people think, only really check ups and special occasions like the photo of them in Endgame.

Now Far From Home. Peter is very reliant on Stark tech and doesn't seem to fully trust his abilities to use them as much. When he meets Fury he's given a pair of glasses that belonged to Tony. When he puts them on later he learns how powerful they were when scanning people's phones and accidentally sending a drone strike on a classmate. WHY THE HELL WOULD TONY GIVE THESE TO A TEENAGER. WHY NOT RHODEY, PEPPER, OR HELL HAPPY. These glasses are almost an exact copy of Ultron, and if they exist why didn't Tony use them during Endgame. Mysterio later gets the glasses after manipulating Peter and we see the destruction and horrors they can bring. It didn't help when everyone expected Petee to become the next Iron Man when he's been doing his own thing for a while.

That's it. That's my full opinion on the whole mentor/weird dad thing Iron Man and Spider-Man been doing. It saddens me when fans say Tony is like a father to Peter when they forget it was Ben Parker who with May took in and raised Peter, the one who's responsible for Peter being the great hero he is.",1,"IMO Iron Man and Spider-Man have a somewhat toxic relationship in the MCU.

His final appearance in episode 19 of season 2 set up his return in Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Lady Sif - After appearing in two Thor movies, Sif returned in the first and second seasons of Agents of SHIELD. She first appeared hunting down the Asgardian Lorelei and returned in season 2 with her memory erased and hunting down a Kree alien.

President Ellis - Matthew Ellis, the former President in the MCU, appeared multiple times on Agents of SHIELD. His return came in season 3 after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, where he formed a SHIELD replacement team in Advanced Threat Containment Unit. His final appearance came when Mockingbird and Lance Hunter were kidnapped in Russia.

Gideon Malick - Powers Boothe made his MCU debut in The Avengers as a member of the World Security Council, but he returned in a bigger capacity thanks to Agents of SHIELD. The series provided a backstory for Gideon Malick, revealing that his loyalties lied with Hydra. He appeared throughout the third season of the show as an antagonist.

Maria Hill - Hill appeared in the pilot episode of Agents of SHIELD and helped bring Coulson's team up to speed. She returned to the series after the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier and helped them deal with the collapse of SHIELD. Hill's last appearance on the show came during season 2, where Coulson is the one who tells her where Loki's Scepter is located so the Avengers can find it at the beginning of Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Nick Fury - He first appeared at the end of the second episode. Fury returned for the season finale after it was revealed Hydra had infiltrated SHIELD and helped Coulson to defeat John Garrett. Even though he hasn't been on Agents of SHIELD since season 1, Fury and Coulson shared the screen again in Captain Marvel.

Jasper Sitwell - Agents of SHIELD episodes 7, 15, and 16. Those were the only appearances made by Sitwell before the Winter Soldier killed him in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

Peggy Carter - Hayley Atwell made a few cameos as Peggy Carter during Agents of SHIELD's earlier seasons. Her appearances in flashbacks coincided with ABC's investment in Agent Carter. Peggy appeared in two episodes of Agents of SHIELD during the second season.

Felix Blake - Appeared in Marvel Studios' One-Shots, Item 47. After this appearance, Blake appeared in three episodes of Agents of SHIELD. He made two appearances in the middle of season 1, with the second episode nearly killing him. But, he made a surprise return in season 3 as the leader of the Watchdogs, a superhuman hate group.

Howling Commandos - Some members of the Howling Commandoes also appeared on Agents of SHIELD. Dum Dum Dugan appeared in the season 2 premiere of the series alongside Jim Morita. Their cameos saw them reunited with Peggy Carter but the entire group featured in Captain America: The First Avenger was not present.

Doctor List - Dr. List appeared multiple times on Agents of SHIELD after making his MCU debut in the post-credits scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It was after the events of that movie that List appeared on the series for three episodes, providing more background on the character and what Baron von Strucker was working on. His final appearance in episode 19 of season 2 set up his return in Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Lady Sif - After appearing in two Thor movies, Sif returned in the first and second seasons of Agents of SHIELD. She first appeared hunting down the Asgardian Lorelei and returned in season 2 with her memory erased and hunting down a Kree alien.

President Ellis - Matthew Ellis, the former President in the MCU, appeared multiple times on Agents of SHIELD. His return came in season 3 after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, where he formed a SHIELD replacement team in Advanced Threat Containment Unit. His final appearance came when Mockingbird and Lance Hunter were kidnapped in Russia.

Gideon Malick - Powers Boothe made his MCU debut in The Avengers as a member of the World Security Council, but he returned in a bigger capacity thanks to Agents of SHIELD. The series provided a backstory for Gideon Malick, revealing that his loyalties lied with Hydra. He appeared throughout the third season of the show as an antagonist. Malick was murdered by Daisy Johnson in episode 17 of season 3.

So many people right now are not happy with the phase 4 movies because they grew up with phase 1-3. “They dont make movies like they did before.” 

Like, phase 4 movies aren’t even THAT bad. They’re decently enjoyable. It’s so annoying to hear everyone complain how marvel has lost it’s charm. Comparing current movies with Iron man and shit. The only reason you got obsessed with Iron man or any other early phase movies is because that shit was NEW to you. Seeing a superhero that can fly, has powers and saves the world with CGI near perfection, for the first time is what sold it all. 


We have  lost the characters that we grew up with. That doesn’t mean we need to turn into damn critics and compare every new movie to the “glory” of marvel’s past movies. Glory in quotes because it was only glorious because it was NEW. Y’all want marvel to sell new stuff, experiment and take risks, but also at the same time don’t fail to compare the new ones with the *old ones* and turn sour like grandpa’s. 

I agree movies CAN be good/bad. But THIS hard criticism? Like your life depends on it? For Thor L&amp;T? Ms Marvel? MOM? She hulk? (for god’s sake that series isn’t even out yet) Every time a new movie comes out y’all are ready to look for and point out all the flaws. Stop putting those movies on pedestal.

1657346268,ImaFireSquid,Overanalyzing the crap out of Loki and Endgame,"The spoiler tag was on, you did it to yourself. Let's go.

In Endgame, Thanos destroys the Infinity stones and is subsequently killed by Thor. Tony discovers time travel, and they go to a separate timeline to get their infinity stones and snap everyone back, which causes that universe's Thanos to switch timelines and go to the universe we know about and die along with his whole army.

In the process of this action, alternate dimension Loki escapes and his timeline is pruned by the TVA, leaving that Loki alive.

HOWEVER

That timeline impacted the ""prime timeline"". It gave the Avengers the infinity stones and gave Tony emotional closure on his daddy issues. At one point the TVA was entertaining two timelines in order to get the prime timeline on the correct path. This has weird implications though.

In the Marvel Universe, deleting one timeline doesn't undo the memories that a timeline switcher might have. Tony having that nice moment with his dad still exists, but his dad was pruned. This also means that Thanos, had he waited any longer, would have been pruned as well.

So here are some crazy implications.

Dr. Strange's ""1 timeline where we win"" is true. They might defeat Thanos any number of ways, but there's one timeline where they don't get pruned.

All the characters from timeline 2 died and were recreated after the events of Loki. Steve may have returned the Infinity Stones to a Tilda Swinton, but not the Tilda Swinton that Hulk got them from. Tony's dad was pruned, but an identical Howard Stark exists in the space where Tony's second dad used to exist.

We can place the beginning of Loki in 2012, but the end of season 1 has to be before 2023 (the year in which Endgame takes place). While the TVA exists in the distant future or an alternate dimension or something, the actual timeline split that occurs at the end of season 1 has to begin prior to 2023.

This also implies that the timeline that Steve goes back to has lost its infinity stones for another reason, possibly to another group of Avengers in another timeline. This means that there's a Thanos surplus. The Tilda Swinton donated their Thanos for Endgame, then imploded, resulting in a new timeline that also donated their Thanos. The TVA made a bonus Thanos for some other timeline to fight in some random way. It could be the Multiverse of Madness Thanos, but it's definitely a violent Thanos for some other dimension to deal with. 

This doesn't matter that much, but I wanted to make sense of some stuff in my head so I wrote it out.",1,"Overanalyzing the crap out of Loki and Endgame The spoiler tag was on, you did it to yourself. Let's go.

I know a bunch of people have already complained about Thor Love And Thunders use of Gorr, but I’ll post this anyway.

The most infuriating thing about this movie, was that Gorr was actually set up well. His backstory was changed to what in my opinion, was a far superior version, however the rest of the movie completely disregarded this, and made him a shallow and generally botched character ( until the end ).

This character just felt wasted on a horribly excecuted rom-com, especially after characters with far less potential were excecuted *so well* in the past.

LAT seemed to randomly alter Gorrs personality, from discount voldemort, to how he should have been excecuted, depending on specific scenes, making his personality seem painfully botched.",1,"Gorr felt wasted on Thor 4 *spoilers*

There was a lot of criticism regarding Multiverse of madness (MOM) but that movie at least tried to deliver something whereas this one is slogging in all aspects. MOM did have a few major drawbacks but overall it's a visual treat and on first viewing, it feels quite well made (except for the ending and parts of second-half maybe). Only on critically analysing do we really understand the wrong aspects of the movie. 

Thor on the other hand is a 'certified disaster'.

Jane Foster(though she delivers an above-average performance) who was absent from the MCU for the last 9 years (not counting the 10s scene in Endgame) is suddenly brought back to the franchise which I felt is quite needless. Jane (unlike Pepper and Peggy) never felt quite at ease with Thor in the first two installments and that was the reason she was axed from Ragnarok(and just look how it turned out). Instead of bringing her back, MCU could have done well to focus on fan-favorite Valkyrie (played by Tessa Thompson) who is reduced to a mere prop in this movie. The only good thing in this movie is Gorr who gets just 5-6 scenes to prove his prowess (thankfully Christane Bale nails that even in the limited time).

1657294166,thekingofallmen,An Honest Review of Love &amp; Thunder [SPOILERS!!],"**TOO MUCH COMEDY IN THE MOVIE**

Thor: Love and Thunder — just like Ragnarok — I found to be full of bad comedy that not even a 12 year old would laugh at. There was perhaps 2 or 3 decent jokes in there. The comedy expertise of Taika Waititi is doing the Thor character more damage than good by turning him back into the moron he was at the beginning of Thor 1. 

In Thor 1, there was an interesting and serious arc where Thor went from a proud and idiotic prince to a much more sensible and caring hero. Recent movies have turned Thor into, at best, a moron and, at worst, a joke. 

**VISUALS**

Thor 1, in my opinion, also had better presentation than Ragnarok. The visuals of Asgard in the opening of Thor 1 were brilliant and truly portrayed Asgard as a realm of gods and heroes, while Ragnarok simply lacks the awe-inspiring, golden glory of Asgard and makes it seem more like just another cool planet. Recent movies have not done Thor any favors. It was clear that Kenneth Branagh had a much more vivid picture of Asgard and he was able to very beautifully translate that picture into film. 

Love and Thunder was pretty similar to Ragnarok in this way. A few Thor 1-like visuals of Omnipotent City would have been quite alluring, although the few that we did see were pretty beautiful. The visuals of New Asgard were perfect also, creating a perfectly appropriate Earth-Asgard mix. 

The visual of Valhalla in the post credit scene was utterly beautiful and didn’t have the flashiness of Asgard, presenting it as the perfect resting place for gods. This humble yet glorious image of Valhalla made it an immediately recognisable heavenly realm that the viewer felt at ease in. 

**PORTRAYAL OF THE GREEK GODS**

Zeus was not presented too great or too poorly. His behaviour was very much in line with the Zeus of mythology and I was very pleased with his showy and selfish attitude, drawing a clear difference between the Greek and Norse gods. The accent was quite bad, making him sound strangely Italian-ish rather than Greek. I think there was an attempt to give him a greek accent but they should’ve taken the Asgardian route and given him a British or American accent instead, as it would’ve sounded less broken and more realistic.

I loved the glimpse of Dionysus, whose costume made it immediately obvious who he was. The women around Zeus also helped to show off Zeus’ personality and, despite not having speaking roles, they had an important part to play in Zeus’ scenes.

**GORR’s PORTRAYAL**

One great point of the movie was Gorr’s portrayal. Christian Bale presented the character very well and Gorr’s humour was most powerful as he was so dark and terrifying, especially in the scene where he killed the snake. His more emotional moments with his daughter felt so real and made me actually like him, although I’m not a fan of what the movie did with Love at the end. Many props to Christian Bale and India Rose Hemsworth, who played Love — yes, she is Chris Hemsworth’s daughter in real life — for their acting in this movie.

**THE USE OF JANE**

While the post credit scene set up Jane’s eventual return as a valkyrie, I think the Mighty Thor was an interesting character as her weakness in her mortal form gave her a perfect reason to keep wielding Mjolnir. I would have preferred to keep the character for a few movies before killing her off, as her arc in this movie felt too rushed towards her death.

But, her death gave us that amazing visual of Heimdall and Valhalla so I really can’t complain.

**CONCLUSION**

A lot of the acting in this movie was magnificent and the movie had a few beautiful visuals that managed to make up for some of the more lackluster visuals we were given in Ragnarok. Bale especially stood out and it is a shame we won’t get to see more of him in the MCU. I loved him in the Dark Knight trilogy and it is good to see that, ten years later, Bale still has what it takes to make a superhero movie amazing! 

In my opinion, Taika Waititi specialises in comedies and his intentionally funny movies are absolutely amazing. But the Thor character was not supposed to be funny. Therefore, I feel that he was the wrong choice for this movie franchise and that Marvel either needs to tone down the comedy or bring back Kenneth Branagh. 

The excessive attempts at comedy continued from Ragnarok and did make the movie a bit less enjoyable, breaking up the flow of seriousness with things like the screaming goats and the “I want to feel shitty about you” line, the latter being said as if he was a kid trying to confess to his first crush, even though he already knows Jane extremely well. 

But overall, a pretty good movie. I don’t think it stands on a par with Multiverse of Madness but it is one of the best movies I have seen (by general standards) and therefore was quite enjoyable.

I loved how Thor went on with Zeus and the Thor/Jane moments were awesome. I had no idea about India Rose Hemsworth’s cameo but that was also incredibly cool and sweet. 

I did however feel the movie was maybe a bit short? Like maybe another 10 minutes of scenes with a bit more character development could have taken to another level. The movie was laugh out loud funny at times, the theater I was in cracked up multiple times, but it felt like every other second there was a joke especially in the first half of the movie, I wouldn’t want to see the jokes cut or anything but 10 minutes total of spacing in the movie could have let the jokes breath a bit better while helping emotionally develop Thor Jane and Valkyrie. 

No real big complaints otherwise! Bale was awesome as Gorr, I know he wasn’t as terrifying and evil as comics Gorr but I think it was a great portrayal.

1657168584,cinemajax,Thoughts on Venom?,"What are your thoughts on this movie? It's definitely no masterpiece by any means, not even close. Hardy does well with what he has to work with, has fun with it all, I mean the man is entertaining no matter what....c'mon. 

He made Eddie his own and did very well with Venom himself. Venom is really a badass character in this movie and definitely the next one, thankfully he was a lot more realized in the sequel, given a lot more screen time and more to do. 

With this movie and Let There Be Carnage (they really should have called it Rise of Carnage or something, that title is so wordy), Venom is a lot closer to past versions of him I've seen in past stuff like games and the 90s cartoon, hell if anything, he's closest to the version of Venom in the PS1 Spider-Man game and it works very well. He's got this over the top personality, has fun in the things he does, says ""we"", his goofy a lot and is intimidating when he wants to be

As for complaints about this movie, the writing definitely needed a lot better writing, a lot of things did not make sense, Riot going across the world for as long as he did inside of this very elderly woman on foot the whole time, when before her he was inside this very fresh young woman? Also the dialogue....wow. The majority of it was absolutely terrible and it was delivered so.....idek how to describe it. 

I mean most of the dialogue between Eddie and Venom was passable to good, but other than that...yikes

And the fight between Venom and Riot was really fucking bad. Shit lighting and overall visuals, sludge-like fighting between to dark colored CGI symbiotes. 

This movie is very messy, but decent for what it is. Hardy definitely makes it watchable and Venom is very nice to watch, and that SWAT scene was easily one of the best parts

In my possibly very unpopular opinion, Let There Be Carnage does vastly improve on the many problems I have with this movie.

1657150140,CappelladiIvanGrieco,Judgment Day: Eternals v Avengers v X-Men... v Inhumans?,"I have a theory: Marvel Wants to reintroduce the Inhumans in the MCU, so in the comics.

Marvel has put a spotlight on Black Bolt in MoM, putting him alongside Mr. Fantastic, Xavier, Captain Marvel and Captain Carter, all characters that have (Cap. Marvel and Carter) or will have (Mr. Fantastic, Xavier) relevance in films, series or comic book runs. Moreover, celestials are introduced seriously in ""The Eternals"" film, so just remember that Inhumans origins are connected to celestials giving Krees the opportunity to create the Inhuman Race.

What if this was just the right occasion to put a bigger comic-spotlight on them, giving people the opportunity to restart reading them, preparing the public for the new series/film about them?  
Similar stuff happened with other heroes, like Black Panther in 2016 (while Cap. America: Civil war was releasing, film featuring the Black Panther for the first time in the MCU). 

Then we have lore-based reasons: Both X-Men (X-Men vs inhumans) and Eternals (thanks to celestials) are connected with the Inhumans, and avengers are playing the part of ""the neutral team"" since the beginning of the event, meaning that there wouldn't be suspence on ""the common villain"" (if they avengers were it) that usually this kind of event features. 

And obv it would be too cool to see the Inhumans back in action, knowing how much potential they have (read Black Bolt 2017), and most of the times (in my opinion) was wasted.

1657105657,wolvera420,I have an interesting theory about Loki in the MCU and his series I noticed Loki never used his actual powers,"So my theory is that since the timeline during the MCU was riddled with getting his butt kicked, the reason why they might have picked that timeline to be sacred was, to thwart Loki from his glorious purpose and never let him meet his full potential.


 he never uses his green spell magic he uses to attack like in Loki, and if he can put a building back together before it falls on him crushing him and put it back standing up he could have taken the hulk, with his mind.

 so why didn't he... and that would be a possibility in the multiversal roulette of choices that could have happened, so why didn't they let him use that power on someone to quite literally move them without doing anything, or even knowing he has the ability learn to see memories and create an illusion with it, I know that was Sylvie's power but if she can do it, it's at least possible that they both can he just hasn't tried, or why didn't he cause gaps in attention you'd think he'd have been more sneaky than he was in the mcu movies. 


Aside from that, the Loki he picked to suffer for so long before finding out there was more, he didn't even let him sit in while Sylvie killed him. instead he picked one where he got thrown into the tva, and I think he was lying about the amount of the timeline he'd seen. it seems only certain that since he only knew up to that point he knew he was going to die because, he hasn't seen passed it and you know he's not being straight up with them. so he picked the variant of himself that thwarted his nemesis the most, so he picked one that Sylvie got mad at Loki so he'd have even less of a chance of being allowed by Sylvie to bare witness, further defeating him before he loosed the timelines letting out infinite amounts of imprisoned variants of himself to start a war with the duo coming to the screen. tho I think she'd do well teaching him sneaky tactics, she's got more stealth on him than a stealth bomber against a square metal wheel on a monster truck with enough power to burn out with it.



Tho I will say that this is just where my mind goes with this I don't actually know for sure, it's just a theory I have that I hope happens, I'd love to see a dialog of the watcher happen after they show up monologuing it maybe even slipping in a fourth wall joke on the side would be awesome. 


 but still it'd be really interesting to see if Loki and Sylvie turn out to be powerful all after this if she entere the MCU as a full time character and the whole mcu turns on it's head now that Loki and Sylvie are a formidable team, and the only reason the watcher chose them as his protagonists is because they were the ones always fighting him. boom Loki becomes the new main antagonist that shield is battling with all of his variants during a multiversal war, Loki vs the avengers and the watcher variant army. but the avengers won't actually know who they are fighting along side until it's too late",1,"I have an interesting theory about Loki in the MCU and his series I noticed Loki never used his actual powers So my theory is that since the timeline during the MCU was riddled with getting his butt kicked, the reason why they might have picked that timeline to be sacred was, to thwart Loki from his glorious purpose and never let him meet his full potential.

1657094261,Envision---,Doctor Strange 2: Multiverse of Madness; Kamar-Taj scene,"# 

Wanda vs Kamar-Taj was honestly the weakest part of the entire film. If I'm actually being honest, probably one the worst action scenes in the MCU.

The whole fight was just Wanda in the air firing her basic psionic blasts &amp; telekinesis. The other sorcerers just used magical canons &amp; arrows. Like seriously? You'd think a battle between a Witch &amp; sorcerers would have a more creative battle than simple attacks. I don't even recall any spells being casted besides the shield thing.

Doctor Strange &amp; Wong literally did not do anything. They just stood there watching the sorcerers get killed while they just retreated inside doing nothing to help them.

If I was making this movie. I would've had Wanda conjure up some of those monsters that she sent after America to attack Kamar-Taj, and actually have the sorcerers actually do something meaningful While Wanda would face off against both Wong &amp; Strange. Instead of them being useless the whole time like they were.

Also, since I'm already here. Why did Strange keep America at Kamar-Taj? I know Wanda had a way of tracking her wherever she was. but Strange at least could've delayed Wanda reaching her by Opening a portal to somewhere else after they lost the battle.",1,"Doctor Strange 2: Multiverse of Madness; Kamar-Taj scene #

Venom himself is done pretty damn well, design, power, and personality. The only thing really missing is no connection to Spider-Man at all, but it doesn't hurt too much....

Hardy certainly makes Eddie is own and Venom too, wouldn't have chosen any other actor actually

I really wish that most of the dialogue got some more rewrites and that final fight definitely was very poorly done and was very ugly, at least Let There Be Carnage was a MASSIVE improvement on that

Nonetheless it is entertaining for what it is and Venom himself was really cool",1,"What are your thoughts on Venom?

1656993674,CrispyGold,Ya know its rather frustrating how MCU synergy has rendered the Avengers and Guardians line-ups unchanging especially in adaptations,"Like its a noticeable thing, the Avengers and Guardians line-ups in the shows and games are always the movie group. These are groups with a fairly diverse array of characters which a main appeal that the line-up shifts overtime with changing and members. But when you look at Avengers Assemble, the Guardians cartoon, and their Square Enix games, its always the same exact characters every time aside from only new guy (Falcon in Assemble, and Kamala in the Avengers game). 

Its extremally rigid especially when you notice how Black Widow and Gamora are the only female members usually. No Scarlet Witch, no Wasp, no Moondragon, or Phyla-Vell, its always just those 2.

And of course this extends to the comics. The Guardians line-up for most of the 2010s until the Cates run was incredibly stale with the Bendis and Duggan runs allowing just the movie 5 as the only cosmic characters. The only new members was during Bendis run and it was strictly Earth characters like Iron Man, Captain Marvel, Agent Venom, Kitty Pryde, and Thing. Its like they were completely adverse to having a cosmic character that wasn't in the movie.

1656806643,JamesPlayzReviews,My Theory for MCU Secret Wars,"Now as we all know Phase 4 is coming to an end and Papa Fiege has been cooking up something (as they say in WandaVision) ""really good!"". In all seriousness he has even stated that he has been teasing for the past few movies and if we look really closely the only thing there to connect the dots is Kang the Conqueror and the Multiverse. So I have a theory that will bring some unexpected surprises.

Secret Wars Hosts in the Past:

Now in the past there have been been many hosts for the event known as Secret Wars, an event where a villain uses his abilities to merge the Multiverse together and have heroes and villains battle to the death for a piece of land. In most universes for example Earth-616 (Main Universe), Earth-9811(Secret Wars: 25 years later), Earth-90251(Doom kept Beyonder's powers), Earth-92131(X-Men and Spider-Man cartoons), and Earth-12041 the host of Secret Wars has been the Beyonder. In other universe such as Earth-616, Earth-92131, and Earth-90251 Doctor Doom has been the host of Secret Wars. In Marvel's most recent animated series for kids Battleworld(basically an animated show all about Secret Wars) aka Earth-TRN896 Thanos and Loki were the hosts of Secret Wars. However as you've seen so far as for powerful beings causing Secret Wars one of the most powerful is missing from the list that villain being Kang the Conqueror.

My Theory:

Being that we already saw a glimpse of Kang in Loki due to both his variant HeWhoRemains and his statue in the alternate TVA. Along with the fact that we are going to see him along with M.O.D.O.K in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. I have a theory that Ant-Man is going to accidentally free Mr. Richards (not Reed for you idiots who aren't paying attention) from wherever he is in the Quantum realm. And in doing so Kang will start Secret Wars, while this would be a first for Kang it certainly wouldn't be much of a surprise. Like if Thanos can do it in a cartoon centered for kids then you bet your boots Kang can do it in a movie meant for teenagers and adults.

Now how would Kang go about doing this you ask? Well most of the time for example comics and TV shows Kang's plans center around time travel or as Marvel rules call it, ""Alternate universe creation"". In the Lego Marvel Universe Kang used a device that he had put on worlds he had been time/universe traveling to and merged the universes into one creating a sort of Secret Wars but it was never officially called that. But maybe Kang could do so again in the MCU this time but this time to create an official Secret Wars.

People That I Believe Would Show Up In This Secret Wars:

Okay so now we've got our story Ant-Man made another foolish mistake and set Kang who was trapped in the Quantum Realm free and he has now created Secret Wars. Now we have to figure out who other than the people of Earth-199999(comics)/Earth-616(movies) would show up. Well let's see we saw a whole bunch of alternate universe characters from Endgame like the 2012 and others, we also have all those Lokis from Loki. Or even the What If...? characters, heck everyone would love to Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield again no question. Maybe we'd finally get a live action version of the characters from Spiderverse. And with how things are going maybe characters like Venom, Morbius (""It's Morbin time""), Vulture, and others could show up and fight Spider-Man since everyone has that theory. Heck we could possibly even finally meet SSU Spider-Man in Secret Wars, though I sincerely doubt we'll see him in Secret Wars before we see him in the SSU.",1,"My Theory for MCU Secret Wars Now as we all know Phase 4 is coming to an end and Papa Fiege has been cooking up something (as they say in WandaVision) ""really good!"".

In most universes for example Earth-616 (Main Universe), Earth-9811(Secret Wars: 25 years later), Earth-90251(Doom kept Beyonder's powers), Earth-92131(X-Men and Spider-Man cartoons), and Earth-12041 the host of Secret Wars has been the Beyonder. In other universe such as Earth-616, Earth-92131, and Earth-90251 Doctor Doom has been the host of Secret Wars. In Marvel's most recent animated series for kids Battleworld(basically an animated show all about Secret Wars) aka Earth-TRN896 Thanos and Loki were the hosts of Secret Wars. However as you've seen so far as for powerful beings causing Secret Wars one of the most powerful is missing from the list that villain being Kang the Conqueror.

My Theory:

Being that we already saw a glimpse of Kang in Loki due to both his variant HeWhoRemains and his statue in the alternate TVA. Along with the fact that we are going to see him along with M.O.D.O.K in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. I have a theory that Ant-Man is going to accidentally free Mr. Richards (not Reed for you idiots who aren't paying attention) from wherever he is in the Quantum realm. And in doing so Kang will start Secret Wars, while this would be a first for Kang it certainly wouldn't be much of a surprise. Like if Thanos can do it in a cartoon centered for kids then you bet your boots Kang can do it in a movie meant for teenagers and adults.

Now how would Kang go about doing this you ask? Well most of the time for example comics and TV shows Kang's plans center around time travel or as Marvel rules call it, ""Alternate universe creation"". In the Lego Marvel Universe Kang used a device that he had put on worlds he had been time/universe traveling to and merged the universes into one creating a sort of Secret Wars but it was never officially called that. But maybe Kang could do so again in the MCU this time but this time to create an official Secret Wars.

People That I Believe Would Show Up In This Secret Wars:

Okay so now we've got our story Ant-Man made another foolish mistake and set Kang who was trapped in the Quantum Realm free and he has now created Secret Wars. Now we have to figure out who other than the people of Earth-199999(comics)/Earth-616(movies) would show up. Well let's see we saw a whole bunch of alternate universe characters from Endgame like the 2012 and others, we also have all those Lokis from Loki. Or even the What If...? characters, heck everyone would love to Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield again no question. Maybe we'd finally get a live action version of the characters from Spiderverse. And with how things are going maybe characters like Venom, Morbius (""It's Morbin time""), Vulture, and others could show up and fight Spider-Man since everyone has that theory. Heck we could possibly even finally meet SSU Spider-Man in Secret Wars, though I sincerely doubt we'll see him in Secret Wars before we see him in the SSU."

So in Multiverse of Madness, we learned that Strange caused an incursion. The question is, where? As far as we know, the Dark Dimension is a **dimension**, not a **universe**. I don't think the incursion is there. Besides, how would Strange be guilty? He could only cause an incursion in universes he's been to.

Unless the Dark Dimension is a universe. That brings me to another discussion which I don't want to open now (it's not the main point), about whether there is only one Dark Dimension (it's a universe) or infinite Dark Dimensions (it's a dimension in every universe).

In any case, where would the incursion be if not the Dark Dimension? Clea can't travel through the multiverse. I get how she would know about an incursion, but how would they fix it? Would they enlist America Chavez's help?

I remember watching stuff like Earth’s Mightiest heroes when I was younger, I barely remember it now but it's how I was introduced to Marvel beyond Spider-Man. I heard recently it would’ve had a third season that would've been as big as some of the DC cartoons back in 00s, but every bit of the cartoon and gaming department was gut by Marvel to be MCU-adjacent. The only good thing I feel we got out of that was Ultimate Spider-Man and even then, plenty of issues. I only really remember watching the later seasons and got pretty good vibes from what it was trying to do, despite the flaws (Which I didn’t gaf about at the time, I loved it). Recent cartoons are terrible, and they just feel like they’re made to advertise the MCU, and have horribly animation, like they expected none of the audience to care. The only good thing we got in a while was Spider-Verse. Marvel used to have a bigger variety of these cartoons and other non-MCU content that could stand on its own legs. Not to mention the total lack of X-Men and Fantastic Four stuff during the majority of last decade on top of everything being MCU ads.

DC these days likes to make stand alone animated adaptations of comic book stories, spin offs that treat all its lore like mythology. They’ve dominated everything except live actions movies. Instead they just feel like soulless ads with no level of creativity. We had a Deadpool cartoon coming up but it got axed bc Disney didn't like it, something called Tigra and Dazzler too. I hear Hit Monkey got a cartoon but I haven't watched it yet, IMO it looks closer to the kind of thing DC would do with their heroes, if anyone's seen it please tell me so or otherwise.

As for their games, it feels like that all dried up as the MCU picked up steam. Spider-Man was a great game but it was a console exclusive, and the only good Marvel game that decade that wasn't delisted. GOTG was also pretty nice but Avengers fucked up the perception of it and they probably won't be able to spring off of that any further. Marvel Infinite was just a big MCU ad.

There's just such a terrible lack in variety in anything that isn't live action, and anything that is live action needs to be MCU-adjacent. I hope in the future cartoons improve, and we get a bigger variety of games (Which may happen) that aren't MCU advertisements.

1656691828,k1410407,Bully Maguire is a character in my Marvel headcanon.,"Among the headcanons I'm writing I thought of the crazy idea of turning a meme like Bully Maguire into a character, someone with an actual role. At this point I don't know how big his involvement will be but the premise I came up with for him involves him being a villain in a multiverse crossover I'm planning. Since the stories are in development they're not meant to be elaborate yet. Basically the meme known as Bully Maguire in this is just an alternate version of the 2002 Sony universe Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) whom in this alternate universe, during the third movie's events chose to embrace the violent and aggressive nature given to him by Venom and in the future uses his genius to become a successful industrialist, but over the course of several years he finds a planet where symbiotes live peacefully but uses the tech he develops to control them with a hive mind (kind of like Tony Stark but with aliens instead of armors), and somehow in a strange twist of events he becomes an evil warlord who kills any superhero in his universe and tries to use his hive controlled symbiotes to rule the world, typical villain goals. But instead of having a cause he just does it cause he can, like the personality we saw in the meme he acts humorous, has a big ego, banters and taunts his enemies, and a characteristic is that he never masks cause his face symbolizes fear to his enemies (or something like that, Bully Maguire never masks).

Among the headcanons I'm writing I thought of the crazy idea of turning a meme like Bully Maguire into a character, someone with an actual role. At this point I don't know how big his involvement will be but the premise I came up with for him involves him being a villain in a multiverse crossover I'm planning. Since the stories are in development they're not meant to be elaborate yet. Basically the meme known as Bully Maguire in this is just an alternate version of the 2002 Sony universe Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) whom in this alternate universe, during the third movie's events chose to embrace the violent and aggressive nature given to him by Venom and in the future uses his genius to become a successful industrialist, but over the course of several years he finds a planet where symbiotes live peacefully but uses the tech he develops to control them with a hive mind (kind of like Tony Stark but with aliens instead of armors), and somehow in a strange twist of events he becomes an evil warlord who kills any superhero in his universe and tries to use his hive controlled symbiotes to rule the world, typical villain goals. But instead of having a cause he just does it cause he can, like the personality we saw in the meme he acts humorous, has a big ego, banters and taunts his enemies, and a characteristic is that he never masks cause his face symbolizes fear to his enemies (or something like that, Bully Maguire never masks). This is just a premise basically, his involvement in my story isn't that deep outside of one confrontation with the main characters but I actually want him to have a fight with Scarlet Witch at some point. I'd like to know what you think about this. I still think it's a ridiculous idea but in my head I think it could work with a good hand."

*Processing img xg3rf6m7vw891...*

1 - Wanda: Her evolution is fascinating. From starting as a secondary antagonist in AoU to her star turn as The Scarlet Witch, no one has been on such a wild journey as her. Her trauma is so severe. Although I didn't like what they did with her in MoM, she'll still be my favorite character no doubt. What Elizabeth Olsen brings to role never fails to impress. 

2 - Cap: This is a man. Played beautifully by Chris Evans, he became one of my favorites in TWS because he's such a loyal friend and genuinely good person. He quickly shot up to #2 in Civil War because I have major authority issues and Cap's choice to flip off the govt here was so satisfying. He trusts his judgement above all else and he's always correct in that. Cap is a man. The ultimate man. 

3 - Sersi: Speaking of the ultimate man, I think Sersi might be the ultimate woman. Despite only seeing her once, Sersi has instantly become one of my favorites because her femininity is her ultimate strength. Her ability to transmute her surroundings feels like an allegory for her ability to heal the world, which she essentially did. Dying to see her again. Gemma Chan delivers on all fronts - love her facial expressions. 

4 - Rocket: Love this furball. Bradley Cooper's best performance. Layered, funny, but also deeply moving. It's a CGI character and yet Cooper's performance transcends that. I'm already mourning the potential loss of him one day should Cooper decide to vacate the role. Cap was given so much story, but I don't know how I can feel satisfied with a Rocket ending. Maybe if he got his own movie. 

5: Nebula: Much like Rocket, this poor woman has been through too much. Choosing the wrong side would not have only been easier for her, but also made much more sense given where she was in life initially, and yet, she zigged when the universe might have expected her to zag. She's introverted but you can tell she craves connection and Karen Gillan just does a wonderful job.",1,"Top 5 favorite characters? Who are you top five favorite characters and why?

I observed a few things about Pizza Dog. 
A. He seemed to be waiting for Kate or someone outside when she first spots him. 
B. He attacks the gangster guy in the alley right as he finds the watch. Seemingly in response to him finding it. 
C.He then disengages from the gangster and barks to Kate before leading her away when she appears a moment later. Almost as if trying to protect her. 
D. He is despite being what appears to be a stray dog not particularly starved or dirty. And his eye while gone seems to have been cared for and well healed. And he is surprisingly well behaved and responsive. 
E. Finally the dog's goal seems to be (to me) to stick close to the watch. For whatever reason. Idk why but. At the end there he is with all of them. Near the watch.

Then... Tony Stark started to be depicted a bit too much like the MCUTony Stark. The world ended to try and give a new starting point for new readers and my breaking point was the whole retcon of Wanda. I do not mind her not being an X-Men, but it felt so forced. 

I ended up fearing that every story would start being molded and changed by the MCU direction.

Now the MCU is pretty big, has a lot of content, so I was wondering if the comics are more indipendent from it? Should I go back to reading? I´ve seen that my fav character is back (Jack of Hearts) and Baldur is prob. back on Thor, and I know none of that is on the MCU so... free of the influence, you think?",1,"Are the comics finally free of the MCU hold?

1656479773,SignificantChair8517,My Pitch For An Avengers Game,"No ideas for a story or campaign, mainly just how it would work and stuff.

It would be an open-world game where you can explore New York. The game would feature Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Thor as the main/starter characters. Eventually, more people such as Black Panther and Ant-Man would be added. You'd be able to switch between all 6 members at any time and the ones not used will occasionally attack an enemy.  Like Insomniac's Spider-Man, there would be the missions tab on the menu which would be used to play missions to play out the hero's origins. There would be an equipment system in the game and it would change the appearance. However, you'd be able to switch to a cosmetics tab that would let you choose armors you have to apply for the look only and change the color schemes of each item or the entire armor, like in Destiny 2.  Iron Man would work differently than this, where he would have the equipment system still, but his would not only buff it but they would be parts of different armors and marks that would be weaker if it's not in the full set. You'd be able to switch into different avengers by using a system like Insomniac's Spider-Man where you hold a button, time slows, and you can choose a character through a menu. It'd also feature an event system, where after the campaign, there would be events where there would be boss battles or big fights, such as a Chitauri invasion or a Black Order battle.",1,"My Pitch For An Avengers Game No ideas for a story or campaign, mainly just how it would work and stuff.

1656462861,whatdidyoudo1,Is Madame Web An All-Female Spider-Verse Movie?,"I have a feeling it might be.

You have Dakota Johnson playing the titular character, Madame Web. I remember, in the animated show (1990s), she put together a team of Spider-Heroes to save the Multiverse.

Sydney Sweeney could be Ghost Spider / Spider-Gwen. Or she could be Black Cat and the Silver and Black movie has been absorbed into this.

Isabela Merced must be Anya Corazon, the monochromatic Spider-Hero.

Emma Roberts could be Spider-Woman, Jessica Drew. Or Gwen Stacy. I saw some fan art and saw that she's pretty much a dead ringer for Gwen. Or Silver Sable.

Celeste O'Connor's could be either Valerie the Librarian, a gender-swapped Miles Morales, a gender-swapped and race-bent Peter Parker (Peta? Petra?). Or a race-swapped Julia Carpenter or Mayday Parker. Honestly, she could be anyone.

If they announce an Asian actor, that must be Silk and possibly confirmation of the kind of movie they might be doing.

If it is an all-female Spider-Verse, I just hope it's good. They need to focus on telling a great and compelling story. It has the potential to be even more of a Multiverse of Madness than Multiverse of Madness! I hope it doesn't turn out like Ghostbusters or Oceans 8.

The MCU has made every single one of their heroes a household name by making them great, recognisable, individual, and compelling characters. I feel like Madame Web, if done right, can do the same.",1,"Is Madame Web An All-Female Spider-Verse Movie? I have a feeling it might be.

Favorite: I would say Spider-Man No Way Home for obvious reasons. Besides getting to see Andrew and Tobey return I really liked what they did with Tom’s Spider-Man in this movie. The journey he went on during the movie was really cool to see. Him having to end up sacrificing his relationships and all his loved ones memories of him really resonated with me and was a big deal for his character.

Least Favorite: 
I would probably say Black Widow. I just don’t like how they handled Taskmaster at all. Also the number of things Natasha was able to survive in this movie made no sense lol. And since we knew her character couldn’t die in this movie it made the stakes feel really low. There we’re some bright spots with Florence Pugh as Yelena.

She's just a terrific character and a villain, absolutely best represented in this movie, and Raimi was the best director for this movie because he brought out that horror vibe in her quite a bit.

There is Thanos obviously, Green Goblin, Kilgrave, Fisk, Jigsaw, Scarlet Witch of course, Ego.. I guess there are more standout villains than I thought, but that still isn't very many given how much MCU content there is

She's just a terrific character and a villain, absolutely best represented in this movie, and Raimi was the best director for this movie because he brought out that horror vibe in her quite a bit. She's easily one of the best villains in the MCU, maybe top five perhaps? There really aren't that many super memorable and great villains in this franchise

There is Thanos obviously, Green Goblin, Kilgrave, Fisk, Jigsaw, Scarlet Witch of course, Ego.. I guess there are more standout villains than I thought, but that still isn't very many given how much MCU content there is

ANYWAY, this movie is similar to TDK I think. Both are badass movies, but they are the kind of movies you'd watch for the villains mostly, the hero being secondary, but given the stories, that's fine by me"

1656245261,db191996,What's the Reason Why Mjöllnir chose Jane ?," 

The reason why Mjöllnir choose Jane as the new Thor in the comics , is that Thor became unworthy, but in the MCU Thor is still worthy and I doubt that the comics unworthy Thor storyline is going to happen in LOVE and Thunder.

After failing in Infinity War , Thor felt unworthy , let himself go, and became a little weird , And he gone on a crazy adventure to find peace.

During the time high Thor got a pep talk from his mom, allowing him to achieve his redemption arc, and him being able to summon Mjöllnir made him feel worthy again.

Which was a type of validation. It was a sign of his failures are forgiven and now he can forge a new path for himself and remember that Ragnarok was about the understanding that he's not defined by his hammer .

**But Who's Jane From Thor Love And Thunder ?**

Remember , Jane is a very smart woman. She's a leading astrophysicist and astronomer, and she's an expert on all things related to Asgard.

She is the first human mortal who probably ever set foot on the ground of Asgard. All of those things are the reason why [she received a Nobel Prize](https://www.hotseatmag.com/article/how-jane-fixes-the-hammer-and-becomes-worthy-in-thor-love-and-thunder).

1656242690,Homo-alono,James Gunn didn’t do the GOTG justice,"I’m gonna preface this by saying I actually like most of Jame’s work. Suicide squad, peacemaker (although I think that show had some major flaws), and I actually think the guardians movies pretty decent as a fun turn off your brain watch. That being said I have some major issues with the way james characterizes the guardians.

Right off the bat let’s all agree that Drax and groot aren’t even really characters. They are both textbook definition of one-note and every chance at them getting any amount of development seemed to be traded for a cheep laugh. Everyone will remember “I am groot” and the “Why is gamora” and “invisible Drax” jokes, but no one actually cares about the characters they came from because there’s nothing to care about.

Rocket raccoon I thought was well done actually. No notes

Gamora is cool when she isn’t just being peters girlfriend. James Gunn seems to really like the “Idiot boy meets badass girl” trope (which I’m not a fan of) and gamora seems to be thoroughly stuck in the badass girl dating idiot boy role. I think her arc with nebula was good and I wish we got more of that. Her being killed off while implying Thanos did truly love her then bringing back a 2014 version was some of the most wtf writing I’ve ever seen but go off I guess.

Mantis hasn’t had a whole lot of screen time but I feel like she’s going in the same direction as Drax and groot, where Pom’s performance is so bubbly and cute that she just gets used for audience pleasing jokes instead of real character growth. Thor 4 screenshots have shown that she’ll be doing something with Thor so hopefully it’s more serious 

Nebula was cool. No notes

Yondu was cool. Although not sure why they made it seem like he was actually a good father figure in the end while spending 2 movies telling us he wasn’t but go off.

And finally Peter Quill. Despite being the the main guardian and the protagonist of both guardians movies, Star lord falls into the same trap as Drax and groot. Half the time Peter could be developing as a character, he’s instead being made the butt of a joke. That joke being that he’s stupid, hence “idiot boy meets badass girl” trope. As much as I love pre-2014 comic starlord, I’m not mad that his outfit, weaponry, and personality were changed. I’m just mad they made him stupid and a joke. The best part about pre-2014 comic Peter was that he was an intelligent leader who had the respect of people way stronger than him. Fine, make him a goofy space pirate, but I hate that he’s an idiot who no one respects despite being the “leader” of the guardians. For the first movie? Fine, but that should’ve changed after or even during the second movie.

So yeah, I guess my main issue with these characters is how often making a joke trumps character development.

1656240408,Harrisontb,Who is Earth 616's #1 hero?,"One thing I've noticed is that in the MCU, Iron Man is essentially seen as the world's #1 hero, probably due to RDJ's great portrayal and the popularity of the character skyrocketing.

1656203966,Honest_Bank8890,I changed my mind,"So rewatching Multiverse of Madness, Ive changed my mind, originally watching this movie I gave it a 7.2/10 as I felt that it regressed Wanda's character and that's the resolution seemed to just wrap up everything as it seemed everything that's happened in the movie didn't matter.

But rewatching for a second time I feel that now Wanda vision has escaped my head a little bit I can see how truly frightening wanda is and I could feel her grief through her performance but still I feel that I could only feel this from her because I have forgotten the journey she took in Wanda Vision, but still good movie

The horror elements were very good I always believed that but I felt they could have just run wild with Wanda, she could if she wanted to destroy universes so why not use it

All in all I give the movie an 8.2/10, but let me hear your guys thoughts on the second watch through",1,"I changed my mind So rewatching Multiverse of Madness, Ive changed my mind, originally watching this movie I gave it a 7.2/10 as I felt that it regressed Wanda's character and that's the resolution seemed to just wrap up everything as it seemed everything that's happened in the movie didn't matter.

But rewatching for a second time I feel that now Wanda vision has escaped my head a little bit I can see how truly frightening wanda is and I could feel her grief through her performance but still I feel that I could only feel this from her because I have forgotten the journey she took in Wanda Vision, but still good movie

1656202973,DontAskHaradaForShit,"I miss Wanda's accent in the MCU. There, I said it.","I liked her ""Sokovian"" accent.  I felt like it gave her character some more flavor, ya know?  But then WandaVision came out and it was just like *Poof!*  Gone, and gone it has stayed.  I've heard people try to argue that it wasn't a good accent to begin with, but we're talking about a made-up accent from a made-up European country.  How does anyone know that isn't just what a Sokovian person sounds like in English?  How do you judge the quality of a fake accent when the accent itself isn't real?

At first I thought it was only gone because they were in an American sitcom on the show, but then the show moved beyond the sitcom stuff and it just never came back.  No explanation, nothing.  If they wanted to get rid of it, they could've at least phased it out gradually, like she was improving her English over time or something, but instead they just gave it the axe without really addressing it.

They did it once with Spiderman and  I thought it was okay but bringing back old actors over and over again just seems like a cheap shot at prying for the audience's nostalgia. Again, I haven't watched dr. strange yet so maybe it's actually good and I'm being cynical but if they do another multiverse movie then it's just giving Disney live-action remakes. 

Also, I feel like they put in so much effort trying to make endgame an epic last hurrah by going all out and killing a bunch of avengers but after throwing away 110% of their material they don't know what to do now hence the (IMO) lazy ideas for new movies. I mean how convenient is it for them to get rid of a bunch of characters and put their stories to rest but now they have this whole new universe where none of that actually happened so they could do it all over again. 

Also, this was written at 3 am after i heard smth of Hugh Jackman coming back as logan in the multiverse and chris evans coming back as human torch and the new young avengers era so if this makes no sense and the English is shitty blame it on sleep deprivation (I'll be taking no accountability but also if u wanna have aggressive discussions in the comments I support that too).",1,"Marvel multiverse concept gives off the same energy as disney live action remakes I haven't watched MUM yet but the entire idea seems like a lazy concept.

**Wandavision**

Likelihood- Very low.

Most likely to get involved- Falcon, War Machine, Dr. Strange, Wang.

&gt;!This is a massive crisis, but it's a massive crisis in podunk nowhere quickly taken over by Sword. The only characters that would even know about it are characters that had high level military clearance and characters who could innately sense that stuff happening. If Dr. Strange didn't smell it, Falcon and War Machine don't exactly have a record of getting involved in sketchy government groups, so they're probably not the top of the ""trust"" list. I put Wang on there because Dr. Strange is unknown, Wang is public information if you know where to look.!&lt;

**Falcon and the Winter Soldier**

Likelihood- Somewhat low

Most likely to get involved- Hulk.

&gt;!In this case, the issue wasn't a major catastrophic threat, just a small group of people with the super soldier serum. The only character that should be really concerned is the guy who got a bad dose of it and turned into a monster. This isn't public information though, so it's unlikely that this is going to have a major impact.!&lt;

**Loki**

Likelihood- Very low.

Most likely to get involved- The Eternals.

&gt;!The Eternals go as far back as human society, so there's no point in time for the TVA to go that the Eternals haven't been, and if you convince them that you're a threat once, they're going to be there 1000 years later, in the exact same physical condition, ready to throw down. They're also quite a bit tougher than Loki, so they're not easy to prune.!&lt;

**Hawkeye**

Likelihood- Incredibly high.

Most likely to get involved- Spider Man.

&gt;!Peter Parker lives two blocks from Rockefeller Center, where the finale of Hawkeye takes place, and it's not quiet. There are guns firing, the tree falls down (a tree that's standing up in the final moments of No Way Home) and Kingpin gets involved, and in the comics, Kingpin and Spiderman fight all the time.!&lt;

**Moon Knight**

Likelihood- Fairy high.

Most likely to get involved- Dr. Strange and Wang.

&gt;!The finale of Moon Knight takes place in Cairo, which is a huge city. This wouldn't be a quiet event, it's just shot from an angle that makes it seem like Cairo is just an empty desert. Dr. Strange and Wang conveniently both have the ability to teleport and the knowledge to say ""oh wow that's a bad magical thing, let me help fight the giant alligator.""!&lt;

**Ms. Marvel**

Likelihood- Incredibly high.

Most likely to get involved- Half of the MCU, but especially Dr. Strange, Wang, and Shang-Chi.

&gt;!Most of the MCU characters live around the vicinity of New York, since that's where Marvel's offices were when most of those characters were created.

1656013207,alexis_ramest,I find it very difficult to get into comics,"Okay so I have two major issues:


1. I really like somewhat old stories. If you've ever played Ultimate Alliance that is the ""era"" of comic book stories. However, I cannot stand the writing of those old comic books, where there was a yellow background panel with the main character doing a flip and about three essays worth of text where said character is thinking about their own powers. Not that I dislike reading but I think modern comics do it right with their combination of visuals and dialogue. Is there a modern version retelling of old stories and arcs?


2. I can't for the life of me find what I'm supposed to be reading after an issue and dislike that a lot of things are happening that I don't know about. Say I'm reading The Amazing Spider-Man number 45 or whatever. Well, when you get to 46 characters talk about events that happened in Amazing Spider-Man even more Amazing that I didn't know about and now I have to look for it. It's even worse when they do it as a series but split into two comics and for this one I have a real example with real issue numbers. If you read Amazing Spider-Man #440 it ends saying you now have to read Peter Parker: Spider-Man #96 which btw I also haven't found in Marvel Unlimited because the one of the time period is named differently and doesn't align with what I'm reading in issue #96 and the one with the correct name is from another time period completely. The story then continues in #441 and then in #97 which I also haven't found. How are you supposed to keep up with this? Why not make it a single issue? Why are there 2000 different issues of Spider-Man all with just 1 number? How can I know when to read them chronologically?


Anyway, thanks for reading my rant and hopefully someone can help me find someway to organize my reading. Surely there are chronological lists and modern retellings but I haven't found them.

1656009132,DasEmperor,I think Ms Marvel went a little hard on the Islam,"I mean, I like the show a lot and will continue to like it. I’d call it the most visually stunning Disney+ marvel show and it’s not close. The villains look comparatively bland but whatever.

I think we’ve now reached the point of trying too hard to talk about Islam though. We had a speech about Muslim headwear, a wedding, a discussion about different social groups, and all the while I didn’t really question it because I’m American and Islam is a minority religion… but then I imagined what it would be like if it was Christian.

They talk about the seating and construction of the church as the preacher gives a lesson, then the very wise preacher offers sage advice to the protagonist. She goes out and does one super thing and the feds immediately know that she’s Christian. The non Christian friend reads the Torah for clues on her superpower, and then they go to a wedding in a church where they say a prayer and do communion afterwards. The heroine even overhears the preacher giving perfect advice to others that happens to apply perfectly to her.

I’m not upset by the amount of time dedicated to Islam or anything since it is a long running show, but I don’t think it’s specifically necessary to go into such detail about character’s religious beliefs in a franchise where we’ve already confirmed two objectively correct religions- the norse and Egyptian pantheons. I watch scenes about Islam and wonder why nobody told them about that time the skeleton bird god and crocodile goddess had a fistfight in Cairo. I don’t think it’s meant to be tragic, but it feels as tragic as when captain America said there was only one God back in 2012.",1,"I think Ms Marvel went a little hard on the Islam I mean, I like the show a lot and will continue to like it.

1656008498,VeganArmieHammer,So the MCU has been doing a pretty bad job with the Young Avengers so far,"Let's take Kate Bishop. Her dynamic with Clint Barton is one of the best in the comics: they're equals, sometimes Kate is the adult in the room, sometimes Clint is, they give each other shit like all best friends do, etc. 

In the MCU, they turned Kate into an annoying fangirl (Renner's own words, btw), a simpering wannabe sidekick and a total klutz for mostly (unfunny) comedic effect. 

Then there's America Chavez. In the comics she's a no-nonsense powerhouse, think Diaz from B99 meets Supergirl. In the movie, they made her a personality-less damsel in distress that spends the entire film running from a fight and cowering behind Doctor Strange like a scared little girl. 

Elsewhere, Billy Kaplan and Tommy Shepherd are still little kids, and we only saw Eli Washington for 5 seconds in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier.

1656001685,lucky_pessimist,[Moonknight] Do you agree with Ammit or Khonsu?,"Do you agree with Ammit or (Khonsu, marc, steven, layla and the rest of the gods)?  
I know that obviously Ammit is portrayed as the villain here so it seems to be ""correct"" to agree with Khonsu bu not neccesarily. Thanos is the villian in the infinity saga but there's discussion online about if what he did was the right thing as well, coz after all I've also heard of some fans saying that the best villians are those who actually believe that they are doing the right thing, especially so for Arthur Harrow.  


Khonsu: ""I only punish those who have chosen evil, I am real justice!""  
He waits for a crime to be committed before punishing them.  


But on the other hand if Ammit was allowed to rule, millions wouldn't have suffered from Hitler's war and genocide and like Harrow said, by the time Khonsu delivers their retribution, people have already suffered, but with Ammit there would be no war, no crime, the world would become an ideal world and I think everyone would be kind hearted? so that way it would seem to make Earth a paradise, not a bad option either.  


As of now I'm in a dilemma myself but I guess I'm leaning toward Khonsu/mainstream opinion because it gives people a chance to change and they might not commit a crime / evil deed after all.

Ok,

Just watched the new doctor strange since it came out on Disney plus today. It had some fun scenes and some really badass ones too. However, the introduction of the Illuminati just for them to die five minutes later was so ridiculous… why even introduce them in the first place? Not to mention, they said the scarlet witch was barely a concern to them, then they proceed to get absolutely solo’d by her. They stood zero chance. I was just watching in disbelief that the movie was written this way. Before I saw it, I knew about how the Illuminati was involved and I was so excited to see them guide strange through the multiverse in an adventure to get home. But it was just them talking trash to strange and then dying. Dumb. 

Black bolt died by yelling because he had no mouth. How? His body can’t handle the sound waves he creates? How does he make them in the first place? They need to travel through his body in order to come out of his mouth. But somehow his head and body can’t handle it. Xavier dies in the most anticlimactic way, with all his psychic powers he can’t do anything to the scarlet witch. Captain marvel gets crushed by a measly stone statue, but Brie Larson captain marvel can fly through thanos’s ship without issue?

1655911930,peekitty,"Sony's ""Sinister Six"" franchise -- what'll it take to create the new ""anti-hero Avengers""?","For gue$$able reason$, Sony is trying to set up their Sinister Six as ""anti-hero Avengers"". While their first two members were ready as-is, Kraven will reportedly be an ""animal lover"" now to fit a more heroic mold. What other tweaks do you think Sony will make?

The roster will apparently be:

**Venom:** They leaned hard into the ""Lethal Protector"" thing in Venom 2, and made the symbiote super likeable. Done.

**Morbius:** In the comics, Morbius ranges from anti-hero to hero already. The film mismanaged this, making him into more of a hypocrite and killer, but they clearly ***thought*** they were creating an anti-hero. So he theoretically fits the role already, but in practice will need a lot of fixing.

(*Related Tangent:* The film flopped hard, and its star has been accused of raping minors. Do you think Sony will proceed as planned, replace Leto, or quietly drop Morbius from the line-up?)

**Vulture:** ""I'm not sure how I got here. Has to do with Spider-Man I think. I'm still figuring this place out, but I think a bunch of guys like us should team up. Could do some good."" Intriguing. But how will Sony turn Toomes into an anti-hero? He's only ever acted in his own self-interest and to protect his family. He kept Peter's secret, but it seemed (to me) that it was because he ""owed him one"" for saving Liz and himself. Was the allure of Morbius strong enough to Morb right over Vulture's selfishness?

**Kraven:** Actor ATJ recently said that Kraven will be more of an ""animal lover"" in this film, which is surprising as Kraven was always the epitomy of the safari hunter, slaughtering rare and endangered creatures. Will this rebranding work? At least Kraven has always had an ironclad code of honor, so that helps him seem quasi-heroic I guess.

**Madame Web:** We don't know much. Will Dakota Johnson play Cassandra or Julia? Will she be just a clairvoyant or explicitly connected to the Web of Life? Fitting her into an anti-hero team will be easy; the real challenge may be giving her an exciting film.

**El Muerto:** A super-powered luchador played by rapper Bad Bunny. I mean, this is either gonna be hilariously enjoyable or absolute garbage, right? There's no in-between. Past that, I've gotta be honest, I know *nothing* about this character. Does the anti-hero thing fit?

So, as far as we know, that's the Sinister Six. Not exactly a classic line-up, but did Sony pick the right characters for their ""not the Avengers"" super-team franchise?",1,"Sony's ""Sinister Six"" franchise -- what'll it take to create the new ""anti-hero Avengers""?

**Vulture:** ""I'm not sure how I got here. Has to do with Spider-Man I think. I'm still figuring this place out, but I think a bunch of guys like us should team up. Could do some good."" Intriguing. But how will Sony turn Toomes into an anti-hero? He's only ever acted in his own self-interest and to protect his family. He kept Peter's secret, but it seemed (to me) that it was because he ""owed him one"" for saving Liz and himself. Was the allure of Morbius strong enough to Morb right over Vulture's selfishness?

**Kraven:** Actor ATJ recently said that Kraven will be more of an ""animal lover"" in this film, which is surprising as Kraven was always the epitomy of the safari hunter, slaughtering rare and endangered creatures. Will this rebranding work? At least Kraven has always had an ironclad code of honor, so that helps him seem quasi-heroic I guess.

**Madame Web:** We don't know much. Will Dakota Johnson play Cassandra or Julia? Will she be just a clairvoyant or explicitly connected to the Web of Life? Fitting her into an anti-hero team will be easy; the real challenge may be giving her an exciting film.

**El Muerto:** A super-powered luchador played by rapper Bad Bunny. I mean, this is either gonna be hilariously enjoyable or absolute garbage, right? There's no in-between. Past that, I've gotta be honest, I know *nothing* about this character. Does the anti-hero thing fit?

So, as far as we know, that's the Sinister Six. Not exactly a classic line-up, but did Sony pick the right characters for their ""not the Avengers"" super-team franchise?"

On the other hand, however, the fact that the MCU is bringing in this new batch of younger heroes seems to hint at a future schism amongst the marvel heroes ala the comic stories where the young avengers grow disillusioned with their legacy counterparts’ increasingly unethical and anti heroic actions.

Honesty, Kamala in particular, with her avengers hero worship, seems to be tailor made for this role of being the true believer that has finally lost faith eventually—as seen in the recent fluster-cluck that was the EA avengers game.

1655764188,Philotics,Continuity and Ego Infinity Stones Theory,"Half Theory / Half Headcanon on how these two extra Infinity Stones, the Continuity Stone and the Ego Stone, fit in the overall power distribution of the collective Infinity Stones. 

[Continuity and Ego Stones](https://preview.redd.it/kwwum6w2au691.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17c7c573aaac3ce3723ba22940135c2bc13a4469)

**The Continuity Stone:** One of the most common weaknesses of the Infinity Stones is that they only work within their native universe. Each universe of the multiverse is supposed to have their own Infinity Stones but taking one set of Infinity Stones outside its home universe leaves them empty of power. In contrast, Deadpool's Continuity Stone is able to step outside of its own comic and into other continuities without losing power. This stone could have the missing aspect of the Infinity Gauntlet that lets it act on the multiversal axis just like the Space and Time Stones let the Infinity Gauntlet act on the space and time axis. Each universe in the multiverse or each piece of media would be its own continuity that this stone would let the other stones act across. This could also be called narrative power or the power of fate. 

**The Ego Stone:** This one is more headcanon as the Ego Stone is more a vessel for Nemesis but I am going to consider what power the Ego Stone would have on its own and what it could offer that is not covered by the rest of the Infinity Gauntlet. Assuming the Ego Stone has a power like the other Stones, then perhaps it would be possible to use it as a vessel for one's own ego rather than just the ego of Nemesis. Another common weakness of the Infinity Gauntlet is that not everyone is able to wield its power, such as the Stones in the MCU damaging both Thanos and the Guantlet after the snap. Using the Ego Stone could also its wielder to fuse their will with the Infinity Stones, merging with them and even becoming a Cosmic Being like Nemesis. This could cover the weaknesses of wielding the power of the Infinity Stones and having a will capable of conceiving how to use their power. It would also cover a third weakness of the Infinity Stones being able to be taken from you as they would be fused with your very being. The other Infinity Stones cover infinite outward control but the Ego Stone could cover inward self control and will to control the overall power of the Infinity Gems. 

**Other Stones:** The Ultimate Universe is another instance of there naturally being eight infinity stones. As far as I am aware, they are never named or explained, but I will still count that as a win for the Continuity and Ego Stones being a natural part of the Infinity Stone collection. The stone growing inside Tony Stark's head could even fit with being the Ego Stone without Nemesis' ego. Other infinity stones that I have seen do not as naturally meld with the original six Infinity Stones. Both the Death and Rhythm Stones that I have seen are not natural Infinity Stones but fakes created with the Reality Stone. The Lego Build Stone I have not seen much about, but it seems to me like it would just be that universe's name for the Reality Stone. Then lastly, the Battlerealm Stones, the ""Nightmare, Evolution, Genesis, War, Chaos, and Death Stones"", appear to be artificial Infinity Stones as well and though their powers are not delved into much, they seem to act like corrupted versions of the regular Infinity Stones rather than being a true part of the set.

1655707098,inklingboi08,My problems with the MCU's treatment of the Multiverse.,"My main problem is the blantant ignoring of Earth-199999 as a designation for the MCU. Earth-616 is and has been the mainline comic universe for decades. DECADES. Meaning, there is and has been one Marvel multiverse for decades. This is supported by Spider-Verse and Spider-Geddon, which both feature cameos from cartoon and movie characters with their own reality designations.

As Iman Vellani said, if the MCU is Earth-616 then Kamala is an inhuman, and aside from the Inhumans TV series and Black Bolt of Earth-838 (if that really is the true designation, seeing as apparently different universes call other universes different things) they don't exist in the MCU, or at least the Terrigen Bomb which awakened her latent Inhuman genes and powers didn't.

This is unlike DC's Multiverse, which combines the main 52 universes, along with their previous incarnations and variations, with the Dark Multiverse and other Multiverses across all of their media, including the Arrowverse, DCEU, etc, into their Multi-Multiverse, or Omniverse.

The term ""omniverse"" is flawed because it comprises all versions of reality, real and imagined, including ours, which would include the entirety of the Marvel multiverse. However this can be easily explained away.

There are multiple crossover Earths that are therefore part of both the DC and Marvel multiverse, meaning that it can be assumed that the rest of the other publisher's mulitverse exists but is understandably not able to be shown due to ownership and copyright.

So let's say Marvel decides to make their multiverse like this, ignoring 80 years of history. Fine. They still don't know the difference between alternate timeline, possible future, and alternate universe. I am 100% convinced that the writers don't actually read the comics, and get most of their knowledge from the internet.

For example, the timeline Steve returned to in Endgame should theoretically be an alternate timeline to the main 199999 (or 616 as every theory is calling it now, but I refuse). By the logic of Loki, this should be a different universe. So how is Steve able live to be old in the main timeline? This should be a possible future. And while possible futures can be alternate universes, time travel altering the timeline is not a reason.

For example, Earth-928, the 2099 universe, shared an identical history with Earth-616 (the comic one). But one event in ITS timeline caused a change that spiraled into the state it's in now.

Also, I've heard people use America Chavez never seeing a version of herself in another universe as evidence that it's a separate multiverse. But by definition, the multiverse is infinite. She has just yet to visit a universe where another version of herself exists.

I'm also convinced Marvel doesn't fully know its own universes. In NWH, we see villains from the McGuire and Garfield films. However, their history is inconsistent with their counterparts from those films.

Their transport to the MCU was similar to 2099, in that though the universe has a shared history, that event in THEIR timeline caused a new universe to splinter out, without influence from another, unlike Loki would lead you to believe. Time is non linear, so when this universe was created at that point, it had always existed separately.And yet, Marvel treated this as the same universe. Alternate TIMELINE, similar UNIVERSE, but not the same.

This is unlike how Tobey and Andrew appeared in the movie. They were pulled directly from their universe in present time, NOT altering the history, and therefore not creating an alternate timeline.

Anyways, thank you for indulging my rant.",1,"My problems with the MCU's treatment of the Multiverse. My main problem is the blantant ignoring of Earth-199999 as a designation for the MCU. Earth-616 is and has been the mainline comic universe for decades. DECADES. Meaning, there is and has been one Marvel multiverse for decades. This is supported by Spider-Verse and Spider-Geddon, which both feature cameos from cartoon and movie characters with their own reality designations.

As Iman Vellani said, if the MCU is Earth-616 then Kamala is an inhuman, and aside from the Inhumans TV series and Black Bolt of Earth-838 (if that really is the true designation, seeing as apparently different universes call other universes different things) they don't exist in the MCU, or at least the Terrigen Bomb which awakened her latent Inhuman genes and powers didn't.

This is unlike DC's Multiverse, which combines the main 52 universes, along with their previous incarnations and variations, with the Dark Multiverse and other Multiverses across all of their media, including the Arrowverse, DCEU, etc, into their Multi-Multiverse, or Omniverse.

The term ""omniverse"" is flawed because it comprises all versions of reality, real and imagined, including ours, which would include the entirety of the Marvel multiverse. However this can be easily explained away.

There are multiple crossover Earths that are therefore part of both the DC and Marvel multiverse, meaning that it can be assumed that the rest of the other publisher's mulitverse exists but is understandably not able to be shown due to ownership and copyright.

So let's say Marvel decides to make their multiverse like this, ignoring 80 years of history. Fine. They still don't know the difference between alternate timeline, possible future, and alternate universe. I am 100% convinced that the writers don't actually read the comics, and get most of their knowledge from the internet.

For example, the timeline Steve returned to in Endgame should theoretically be an alternate timeline to the main 199999 (or 616 as every theory is calling it now, but I refuse). By the logic of Loki, this should be a different universe. So how is Steve able live to be old in the main timeline? This should be a possible future. And while possible futures can be alternate universes, time travel altering the timeline is not a reason.

For example, Earth-928, the 2099 universe, shared an identical history with Earth-616 (the comic one). But one event in ITS timeline caused a change that spiraled into the state it's in now.

Also, I've heard people use America Chavez never seeing a version of herself in another universe as evidence that it's a separate multiverse. But by definition, the multiverse is infinite. She has just yet to visit a universe where another version of herself exists.

I'm also convinced Marvel doesn't fully know its own universes. In NWH, we see villains from the McGuire and Garfield films. However, their history is inconsistent with their counterparts from those films.

Their transport to the MCU was similar to 2099, in that though the universe has a shared history, that event in THEIR timeline caused a new universe to splinter out, without influence from another, unlike Loki would lead you to believe. Time is non linear, so when this universe was created at that point, it had always existed separately.And yet, Marvel treated this as the same universe. Alternate TIMELINE, similar UNIVERSE, but not the same.

This is unlike how Tobey and Andrew appeared in the movie. They were pulled directly from their universe in present time, NOT altering the history, and therefore not creating an alternate timeline.

1655550736,Old_Mill,"This is a long shot, but I am looking for a very specific comic panel from a Spider-Man comic.","Long story short, when I was a kid in the mid early to mid 2000's there I went to a library and there was a big black and white book of Spider-Man comics. From what I know about comics now this must have been a collection of reprints, given it was in black and white. I assume it has to be from The Amazing Spider-Man, *maybe* Spectacular Spider-Man, but I don't know much about if they made any big reprint books of those, especially in black and white. I assume it can't be Ultimate Spider-Man despite the popularity at the time given how new the series was, I very much doubt they had any black and white reprints of it then, if they even have them now.

So, I have given the backstory I can and my speculation, from my memory, this is what the actual panel was: 

I assume Spider-Man was sneaking around and spying on someone. I just remember he was probably on a wall spying on someone because the specific thing I remember is he said, **""Gloves don't leave finger prints""**. That is the only concrete thing I remember for sure, I think he may have been being accused of something, but that part could be completely wrong. 

This is why I said it is a long shot, I can't remember much other than the time period, **(mid-2000's)** and he said **""Gloves don't leave finger prints.""**

I don't know if anyone here can help me, but thank you for anyone who tries!",1,"This is a long shot, but I am looking for a very specific comic panel from a Spider-Man comic.

From what I know about comics now this must have been a collection of reprints, given it was in black and white. I assume it has to be from The Amazing Spider-Man, *maybe* Spectacular Spider-Man, but I don't know much about if they made any big reprint books of those, especially in black and white. I assume it can't be Ultimate Spider-Man despite the popularity at the time given how new the series was, I very much doubt they had any black and white reprints of it then, if they even have them now.

So, I have given the backstory I can and my speculation, from my memory, this is what the actual panel was: 

I assume Spider-Man was sneaking around and spying on someone. I just remember he was probably on a wall spying on someone because the specific thing I remember is he said, **""Gloves don't leave finger prints""**. That is the only concrete thing I remember for sure, I think he may have been being accused of something, but that part could be completely wrong. 

This is why I said it is a long shot, I can't remember much other than the time period, **(mid-2000's)** and he said **""Gloves don't leave finger prints.""**

I don't know if anyone here can help me, but thank you for anyone who tries!"

Watching them back to back, there were a couple of weird plot holes that seem like inconsistencies, but I'm guessing were just deleted scenes that were never explained.  Does anyone know the answers to these?

1. In Infinity War, after Thor makes Stormbreaker, Thor/Groot/Rocket are teleported to Wakanda in the middle of the battle via the Bifrost.  However at the beginning of the movie, Heimdall is killed and uses the Bifrost Sword one last time to teleport Hulk back to earth to warn the Avengers.  If Heimdall is dead and the Bifrost Sword is still on the ship in space, how did they teleport? (Thor clearly didn't have it, as he had to travel via space ship to Nidavellir)
2. In Endgame, Valkyrie and a decent chunk of Asgardians are on Earth.  How did they get there, when the Asgardians were shown as killed by Thanos in Infinity War?
3. At the end of Guardians of the Galaxy 1, there's a big deal made of the Guardians saving Xandar &amp; giving the Power Stone to the Nova Corps for safekeeping - even going so far as to show John C Reilly's character reuniting with his wife and kids.  Then Xandar is destroyed off panel in Infinity War, meaning it's sort of the Guardian's fault that they left the Infinity Gem there.  Is this ever touched on?  Maybe something for Guardians 3?
4. How come the rat that frees Scott Lang from the quantum realm doesn't get any cred?  That rat is single handedly responsible for defeating Thanos!

1655486911,Lostlight_awesome_04,How did Vulcan survived at the end of WoK(War of kings),"So a little while ago I was doing some rereading of some past X-men stories written in the 2000s because I was shocked to learn there was actually a 3rd Summers brother aka Gabriel Summers(Vulcan) which suprised because he was such an obscure character that I didn't knew existed. So I decided to do some research and read story arcs regarding this 3rd Summers brother, what I found interesting is that at the end War of Kings, Vulcan was severly injured by Black Bolt to the point where what's left of him are bones and muscles yet somehow and also he lost his prosthetic eye which replaced the one he loses to Gladiator. But the next time we see him in the Krakoa X-men era he was as good as new like there was no damage done to him, and according to his memories it doesn't seem like he was severly injured during his time trapped in the vault. While I don't know how is this possible there are some few gusses:

1. As stated in his Marvel database page, while Vulcan can manipulate energy to heal himself, his power were not strong enough to the point where he can regenerate lost portions of his body such as losing his eye to Gladiator. So it could be possible that Vulcan's healing power elevated to a regeneration level allowing him to regenerate his whole body, but that seems less likely possible unless the writers decided to change that.
2. The second guess is that he somehow transformed himself into pure energy and merged with black bolt before being extracted by the eldritch beings in the Vault. Now this theory was suggested about 2 years ago by a comic book reader rereading some of Hickman's run for the FF #6 and spotted the drawings are exactly mirrored the ones in 2019 X-men #8, and since how Black Bolt escaped the Vault was never explained to us we can guess something must have happened between the two(The link for the theory:[https://twitter.com/abyssalodin/status/1237784453230891009?s=21](https://twitter.com/abyssalodin/status/1237784453230891009?s=21))
3. The third guess is or what I believe is the most reasonable answer is that during the end of War of Kings, Vulcan and Black Bolt did indeed died in the end of King of Wars, however at the end of their battle, both fell into the Vault, and doing some research the some called Vault Vulcan was trapped in was actually the Cancerverse. If you don't know what the Cancerverse is, it's basically a reality in which Death no longer exists thus nobody can die in that universe and it is being invaded by cthulu or eldritch beings. Due to its unique property of lacking the concept of death, even if you're from another reality once you die in this universe, you will be completely healed and revived there, this has been proven in [*Guardians of the Galaxy* Vol 3 #18](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol_3_18)\-19. When Star Lord use the cosmic cube successfully obliterating Thanos to ashes,  only for Thanos to remerge seconds later and kill Quill, then not so far away from his place of death Quill was also completely revived and healed, with no signs of injuries. Therefore I believe that by the end of WoK both actually died, but due to them dying in a universe where death doesn't exist they both got instantly revived and healed of all previous permanent injuries, explaining why when we later saw Vulcan reappeared in 2019 Hickman's X-men run there was no sign of his scar or his prophetic eyeball.

But I'm going on circles trying to find their storylines. The Marvel Unlimited app doesn't really sort results very well. For example, I searched for The Beyonder and it pulled random individual comics from various seperate storylines. 


Really annoying. 


Do you guys just read online articles about the characters and just do away with storylines? I'm not really a big fiction reader so when I do read fiction I like to approach it with a categorical mind. I need everything. All details; given that these characters have been around since the 50s. But I'm just floundering about looking for reference material within the narratives. 


Any ideas about what I should be doing here?"

1655404059,Jorgesgorge1977,Miss my comics,"I see a lot of people sharing old comics on here… here’s my story. So I began collecting comics when I was seven. My grandparents owned a small variety store and every weekend, I’d go work Saturdays and Sundays. It was menial tasks such as stock the cans, wipe down shelving, stack newspapers. But every time I’d finish, my grandmother would let me pick one comic, a chocolate milk, and a chocolate bar. So over a year I’d collected quite a few and this went on for five plus years. But when I was ten, I’d gone to my other grandparents with my father, and my uncle was cleaning junk out of his old room. I use junk as a loose term here, as he had milk crates full of comics from the late sixties/early seventies. I asked if I could have them hand he said yup and gave them all to me. So by the time I was ten, I had  1000’s of comics and mostly marvel. 

Some of the comics I had were:

Avengers #1 

Incredible Hulk #1 

Fantastic four- first time with Dr. Doom 

Spider-Man- first time with the punisher (for that I had the original and the reprint from the 90’s 

Anyways all of these comics were in bags with cardboard backing, and at least 65% were in fair to good shape. We’ll fast forward twenty years and my basement floods while my wife and I are gone on vacation. Those comics by the time we got home were destroyed, and by destroyed I mean mulch. In the plastic bags they’d basically just deteriorated into nothingness? Contact my insurance company, and they told me without proof of the price of them, they could only give me the bottom price on all. Pretty sure I was sitting on approx 50k worth of comics, and ended up getting 5k for the insurance money and that included other property that got ruined. I miss my comics, so thanks for sharing.

1655309816,The_GOAT_Himself,How Endgame will play out if the other half got dusted,"Just a quick FYI that this is technically not my idea I just found it very interesting and am passing it on. I saw this based on a video. I also am going to try to keep this as close to the original events of Endgame as possible

So the first thing we need to know is who got dusted. And in this scenario the following got dusted.

* Captain America
* Thor
* Black Widow
* Hulk
* Rocket Racoon
* War Machine
* Okoye
* Iron Man
* Captain Marvel
* Hawkeye
* Nebula

And these are the following that survived.

* Black Panther
* Spiderman
* Dr. Strange
* Bucky Barnes
* Scarlet Witch
* Falcon
* Wasp
* Star Lord
* Drax
* Mantis
* Groot
* Shuri
* Ant Man
* Nick Fury
* Hank Pym
* Janet Van Dyne
* Maria Hill
* Wong

Now there are two loopholes to this. The first is Thanos who will be unsnapped in this scenario for reasons and the second is Ant-Man. Ant-Man was originally snapped off in the video but in my version he stays.

Before the time heist  Dr. Strange teleports the Avengers on Titan to the Avengers compound and the ones in Wakanda will fly to the Avengers base.  To get to Thanos Shuri will track the energy signatures of the infinity stones to Titan and to get there they can use the Benetaur or Black Panther sponsors a Wakandan ship to get there. After they learn that Thanos destroyed the stones Scarlet Witch will kill Thanos or maybe they bring him back as prisoner.

After the 5 year jump Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne bring back Ant Man who suggests time travel. The Avengers are on board the time heist begins.

Of course with Hank Pym around they can easily make pym particles and Scott Lang suggests using he Quantam Realm. With the combined efforts of Shuri, Hank, and Janet the time machine is born.

In this scenario the unsnapped Avengers will go to the following places to gather the infinity Stones.

* Morag (2014)
* Knowhere
* Vormir
* New York (2012)

So let's start with Morag. In this scenario Star Lord and Spiderman will go to Morag to collect the power stone. The two Peters will bond by talking about movies or something. Of course during this time Gamora is still alive and when Star Lord sees her he will get  all emotional and idiotic resulting in the 2014 Thanos capturing him. Meanwhile Spiderman makes it back with the Power stone.

Now let's move on to New York 2012. In this scenario Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Bucky will go after the Time, Mind, and Space stones. Dr. Strange gets the time stone from the ancient one no problem. Maybe the ancient one can give a few tips on executing the time heist better. Bucky will go after the Mind Stone and will fight the 2012 Steve Rogers. Black Panther, Ant-Man, and the Wasp will go after the space stone but one thing happens after another and Loki takes the Tesseract and dips.

Because of the Tesseract incident Dr. Strange and Black Panther go to Asgard 2013 to steal the Space stone from Odin's Vault. You know Thor was too drunk to point this out but the Tesseract was taken to Asgard after the battle of NY.

Using the Benotaur or a Wakandan ship Shuri, Scarlet Witch, and Falcon will go to Knowhere to steal the reality stone from the collector. Shuri will get a ton of inspiration from the space journey.

Finally we get to Vormir. In this scenario Drax, Mantis, and Groot will go to get the soul stone. Of course on Vormir one has to sacrifice something they love to get the stone. So Drax will die as he never really did anything else before the time heist and he never had any motivation besides avenging his family. The Guardians of the Galaxy are family and Drax’s death would motivate them to push their cause and also it would give Drax an interesting point of view. Groot and Mantis make it back.

Now the 2014 Thanos has to make it back to the present. Thanos will learn about his future through Star Lord’s point of view. He then uses Star Lord’s pym particles to transport him, his army, and Star Lord to the present. Star Lord will then convince Gamora to switch sides.

Now its time for the snap itself.  Shuri will make the infinity gauntlet out of vibranium. Now who will snap the gauntlet? Without Thor, Captain Marvel, and Hulk there really isn't that many people who can take the force of the infinity gauntlet. Dr. Strange is a good contender but I don't think he is durable enough to take the force. Rather I think Scarlet witch will snap the gauntlet to bring everyone back. Wanda's powers were enhanced by the mind stone so it makes the most sense in my opinion. Wanda survives but is traumatized by the affects of the Gauntlet. 

 Thanos attacks and the portal scene in endgame takes place. After this everything is the same as the original timeline. 

Let me know if you think the Endgame will play out like this if the other half got snapped in the comments below.",1,"How Endgame will play out if the other half got dusted Just a quick FYI that this is technically not my idea I just found it very interesting and am passing it on. I saw this based on a video. I also am going to try to keep this as close to the original events of Endgame as possible

So the first thing we need to know is who got dusted. And in this scenario the following got dusted.

* Captain America
* Thor
* Black Widow
* Hulk
* Rocket Racoon
* War Machine
* Okoye
* Iron Man
* Captain Marvel
* Hawkeye
* Nebula

And these are the following that survived.

* Black Panther
* Spiderman
* Dr. Strange
* Bucky Barnes
* Scarlet Witch
* Falcon
* Wasp
* Star Lord
* Drax
* Mantis
* Groot
* Shuri
* Ant Man
* Nick Fury
* Hank Pym
* Janet Van Dyne
* Maria Hill
* Wong

Now there are two loopholes to this. The first is Thanos who will be unsnapped in this scenario for reasons and the second is Ant-Man. Ant-Man was originally snapped off in the video but in my version he stays.

Before the time heist  Dr. Strange teleports the Avengers on Titan to the Avengers compound and the ones in Wakanda will fly to the Avengers base.  To get to Thanos Shuri will track the energy signatures of the infinity stones to Titan and to get there they can use the Benetaur or Black Panther sponsors a Wakandan ship to get there. After they learn that Thanos destroyed the stones Scarlet Witch will kill Thanos or maybe they bring him back as prisoner.

After the 5 year jump Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne bring back Ant Man who suggests time travel. The Avengers are on board the time heist begins.

Of course with Hank Pym around they can easily make pym particles and Scott Lang suggests using he Quantam Realm. With the combined efforts of Shuri, Hank, and Janet the time machine is born.

In this scenario the unsnapped Avengers will go to the following places to gather the infinity Stones.

* Morag (2014)
* Knowhere
* Vormir
* New York (2012)

So let's start with Morag. In this scenario Star Lord and Spiderman will go to Morag to collect the power stone. The two Peters will bond by talking about movies or something. Of course during this time Gamora is still alive and when Star Lord sees her he will get  all emotional and idiotic resulting in the 2014 Thanos capturing him. Meanwhile Spiderman makes it back with the Power stone.

Now let's move on to New York 2012. In this scenario Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Bucky will go after the Time, Mind, and Space stones. Dr. Strange gets the time stone from the ancient one no problem. Maybe the ancient one can give a few tips on executing the time heist better. Bucky will go after the Mind Stone and will fight the 2012 Steve Rogers. Black Panther, Ant-Man, and the Wasp will go after the space stone but one thing happens after another and Loki takes the Tesseract and dips.

Because of the Tesseract incident Dr. Strange and Black Panther go to Asgard 2013 to steal the Space stone from Odin's Vault. You know Thor was too drunk to point this out but the Tesseract was taken to Asgard after the battle of NY.

Using the Benotaur or a Wakandan ship Shuri, Scarlet Witch, and Falcon will go to Knowhere to steal the reality stone from the collector. Shuri will get a ton of inspiration from the space journey.

Finally we get to Vormir. In this scenario Drax, Mantis, and Groot will go to get the soul stone. Of course on Vormir one has to sacrifice something they love to get the stone. So Drax will die as he never really did anything else before the time heist and he never had any motivation besides avenging his family. The Guardians of the Galaxy are family and Drax’s death would motivate them to push their cause and also it would give Drax an interesting point of view. Groot and Mantis make it back.

Now the 2014 Thanos has to make it back to the present. Thanos will learn about his future through Star Lord’s point of view. He then uses Star Lord’s pym particles to transport him, his army, and Star Lord to the present. Star Lord will then convince Gamora to switch sides.

Now its time for the snap itself.  Shuri will make the infinity gauntlet out of vibranium. Now who will snap the gauntlet? Without Thor, Captain Marvel, and Hulk there really isn't that many people who can take the force of the infinity gauntlet. Dr. Strange is a good contender but I don't think he is durable enough to take the force. Rather I think Scarlet witch will snap the gauntlet to bring everyone back. Wanda's powers were enhanced by the mind stone so it makes the most sense in my opinion. Wanda survives but is traumatized by the affects of the Gauntlet. 

 Thanos attacks and the portal scene in endgame takes place. After this everything is the same as the original timeline.

1655284307,Funnie_Croc,MORBIUS and MONSOON,"“Hey,” Red mumbled, standing behind Cyan as he tried to tap two differently coloured wires together.

Cyan didn’t turn, but nodded in acknowledgement. “Hey yourself.”

He was engrossed enough in his task to not feel Red’s arms slip around his body and press his hands onto his ribs, and he didn’t notice, not until Red gently took the zipper at his collarbone and started pulling it down.

And as well as that, Red’s helmet was similar to a gas mask, so Cyan could feel his warm breath against his neck, and it made him shiver.

“... Ok, what are you doing.”

“Mmh. Nothing.”

As he started to register what was happening, Cyan thought about fighting back, but then he realised how badly he actually wanted- no, needed this.

I mean, come on, they’d all been on the same ship for seven weeks, and Cyan wasn’t desperate enough to wanna touch them (except sometimes he’d come in his pants like some sort of teenager reading Demetri comments on Reddit whenever he thought too much about Red).

Besides, Cyan did find Red kind of hot, and he was pretty touch-starved-

“If you wanna fuck me,” Cyan huffed almost impatiently, closing the wire panel as he finished the task just then and turned around to face Red, “then just say it.”

“Fine,” Red grunted, pinning Cyan to the wall. “I wanna fuck you. Hard.”

Cyan yelped in surprise when Red’s tendrils grabbed his wrists and yanked them above his helmet.

“And I want you screaming for me.”

“So. Leeches-” Green began, but then Yellow cut him off.

“We are NOT having this discussion again.”

White glanced across the table and at the pair, amused. “Aw come on, let the man speak - he has a point.”

“Shut up, you rip-off Hitler.”

“Fight me, suka—”

He grunted as Blue gently swatted his head, frowning in annoyance.

“Don’t be mean,” he mumbled. “besides, where’s Red and Cyan? It’s spaghetti today, and they both love it.”

“Maybe we can find them on the cameras?” Green suggested.

Then, as if in a silent agreement, everybody stood up, left their plates, and started towards the camera room.

Blue went ahead of them, entering the room first and turning them on-

And then surprised everybody by letting out some sort of noise of exclamation.

“Er. What is it, comrade-”

The other three froze as they stared up into the screen - and watched in surprise as Red fucked Cyan into the wall.

They all let out a collective ‘oh’ as Green fell backwards and passed out.

“O-oh fucking h e l l —” Blue covered his eyes over his helmet, while Yellow continued staring, reaching down to poke Green awake.

“We- we should probably t-turn the monitor off and-”

“No.”

Blue stared at White, sputtering and steaming madly. “What do you m e a n, no?”

“I mean, ‘no’. This could be... Good research.”

Green finally woke up, and was blushing so hard that you could actually see the blush pass his helmet. “I- so we’re just gonna watch while they-”

“Fuck, that’s- kind of hot.” Yellow whispered, shaking a bit.

So without further ado, they all proceeded to watch the cameras without hesitation.

Cyan whined shamelessly, body quaking with excitement as Red’s stupidly long and slimy tongue wrapped around his length.

The scientist almost felt ashamed that he was enjoying this so much - he used to be one hell of a Dom before, and now he was nothing short of a writhing bitch under Red’s control.

Control.

The word stood out in his mind, hands clenching into fists as he THOUGHT he felt teeth, a heated grunt bubbling from his throat when his ears were filled with the sweet sounds of Red’s own moans around his member.

“Oh, Red,” Cyan gasped out. “please Red, please-“

He already felt his climax coming to hit him like a bat agains a baseball, his cherry ready to pop any second now, and he braced himself to cry out passionately-

When Red just.

Stopped.

His tongue removed itself from his member, and he got up, now level with Cyan, who was quivering with both utter rage and pure bliss.

“Not yet,” He heard Red whisper huskily as he reached down for his own zipper. “I wanna feel good too.”

Cyan was helpless - all he was able to do was whimper as the alien in front of him grab his own cock and start to circle the tip with his thumb.

He pressed his left elbow into the wall, right next to his head, panting softly as he jacked himself off.

Cyan struggled against the tentacles now, desperate to come, he was s o fucking close, but they were too strong; Red moaned a bit louder now, setting a quicker pace as he felt a feeling similar to having warm honey poured into his veins.

And then he came, the cum spurting in thick ropes over Cyan’s own member, aggravating him even further.

“Fuck’s s a k e, Red, lemme come already—”

And he yelled in absolute blinding pleasure as Red grabbed his dick and squeezed it, fisting and milking him for all it was worth, as Cyan practically choked on his own sobs, body wracking with them.

When Red’s tentacles finally let go of his now achingly sore wrists, he collapsed onto his big body, gasping for breath.

“Mm...” Red hummed, embracing Cyan lovingly. “You did so well, love...”

“L-love?” Cyan chuckled shakily, hugging back. “Well, if... You insist.”

Almost instantly did he drift to sleep.",1,"MORBIUS and MONSOON “Hey,” Red mumbled, standing behind Cyan as he tried to tap two differently coloured wires together.

1655266440,Hungry-san,I am so lost. Can someone help me figure out what happened in Thor 2007?,"I was reading about some scheme with Asgard in Latveria, Doctor Doom and Loki and suddenly so much happened off camera.

1655257185,Clebcalb,"If Earth is to Galactus as a Big Mac is to a normal man, Galactus would still only be 1/3 as tall as the Sun.","Sometimes when I think about Galactus, I think it’s stupid how huge he is sometimes portrayed as being , that he could hold the whole earth in his hand. That would make him incredibly large. But after seeing a picture of the earth compared to the sun, it got me pondering just how huge the universe really is. So I did some math to figure out how Galactus would compare to the sun, if he could literally eat the earth like a Big Mac. (I know he usually uses machines to convert the planets to energy, but I’ve still seen him portrayed as big enough to actually eat them.)
Here’s the math:

A Big Mac is 2 inches tall, according to Google. Assuming a 6-foot man, this puts a man at 36 Big Macs tall.
The Earth’s diameter is approximately 7917 miles. So if Big Mac:Man = Earth:Galactus, we should multiply Earth’s diameter by 36 to find Galactus’ height.
That yields 285,012 miles as G’s height
The sun’s diameter is 865,370 miles. That is almost exactly 3 times the height we calculated for Galactus.

So, while he would still be ENORMOUS, don’t get me wrong, Galactus would still be dwarfed by the Sun. I don’t know why this was interesting to me, but I hope it was for you too. Sometimes it’s just cool to think about how huge our universe really is.

Here are some bonus comparisons:
At this scale, compared to Galactus,
-The moon would be the size of a skittle.
-Saturn would be about 1/4 his height.
-UY Scuti, the largest known star, has a diameter so large that even at Galactus’ scale, it would be nearly 6 miles long.",1,"If Earth is to Galactus as a Big Mac is to a normal man, Galactus would still only be 1/3 as tall as the Sun.

1655043562,AffectionateWeb7803,The Hulk in Endgame is a great analogy for mental health and therapy,"  I have seen lots of references to mental health with other characters, but I have had this theory that one of the most important themes with mental health for this phase of Marvel was Smart Hulk. 

We all know Hulk is rage, and in Infinity War Hulk didn’t want to come out and this led to a battle with Banner who then had to use one of the Hulk Buster suits to participate in the battles. 

In Endgame when we first saw Smart Hulk in the diner he says:  

“For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in the gamma lab; I put the brains and the brawn together... and now, look at me. **Best of both worlds**.” 

This is important because now we have Hulk’s strength AND Banners intelligence at one time which was imperative for the Avengers’ success. When it was time for someone to snap their fingers, only Hulk could do it and survive. If Hulk was in his rage form, without Banner's mind, he would not be able to cognitively control himself to bring everyone back. 

We know from how Stark died that no one else would be able to survive, maybe Thor, but he was dealing with his own grief and as Stark said: 

“It’s not just that that glove is channelling enough energy to light up a continent, I’m telling you. you’re in no condition”.  

I’m currently watching that part as I type, and you can even see Banner/Hulk thinking about what he must do and what it could do to him. 

For me, this is the perfect analogy for mental health and therapy. It is really difficult having a mental heal diagnosis we can’t control, and oftentimes feel like it controls us. But through therapy and spending some time getting to understand and know ourselves better, we may be able to become a better version of ourselves. Like Banner and Hulk did in the gamma lab.

Personally, I was diagnosed with OCD 8 years ago. While it sucks to have intrusive thoughts and compulsions. A “good” part of it is intense focus and almost becoming obsessed with thoughts or a goal or “if I don’t do this other thing will happen”. Through therapy and lots of difficult EPR, I can focus that energy on really big goals. While I work on not becoming obsessed with that goal, I do feel I can use some extra mental processing and problem solving to overcome obstacles.  

I have friends with other mental health challenges expressing similar sentiments after therapy or medication. Not at all speaking for everyone, but it is always an interesting conversation, and I have wanted to share this idea of Hulk and therapy for a long time.

I have friends with other mental health challenges expressing similar sentiments after therapy or medication. Not at all speaking for everyone, but it is always an interesting conversation, and I have wanted to share this idea of Hulk and therapy for a long time. 

Thanks for reading!"

I pick up the comics of the characters that interest me and usually before an MCU debut of a character I didn’t know much about I read the essentials. I love 616 but I’ve never read Secret Wars 2015, I don’t know why but well, now I want to and I know it’s a big story so I’m gonna read some stuff before. I haven’t read absolutely every issue since the 60’s but pretty much there with Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Moon Knight, Daredevil, X-Men, Wolverine, Hawkeye, Thor, Kamala Khan a lot of Avengers and West Coast, New Avengers etc. And many others I’m really familiar with. I’ve read a lot of 616 post Secret Wars with events and characters I love so I’m catch up I know about the world ending and rebooting but now I want to go back and read Secret Wars this cause as I said I don’t know why I haven’t done it yet and I want to experience the whole thing. Also read some of the preludes like in Ms Marvel last days. This is a list of events and issues that what I’ve come up with looking in the internet with different reading orders to catch up pre Secret Wars. Some of those I’ve already read but I want to have them fresh in my memory. I also plan on reading the Ultimate Universe before.

Basically I would really appreciate all your expertise Marvel fans of this sub to tell me if there are some more issues and events that I’ve missed that would improve my experience reading Secret Wars. It’s gonna be long but I hope it’s worth it. I would also appreciate if you told me which Secret Wars tie ins and BattleWorld issues are the best for you, when I read an event I usually only read the tie ins for the series I’m following, I’ve read everything for Civil War for example and it was too much. I’ve read the Thors one when I read Aaron’s Thor and liked it so if you guys tell me the best tie ins I’ll listen. Thank you! Have a good day if you don’t have suggestions. 


What I plan on reading is:

- Ultimate Universe
- Maybe reread 1602 if I have time

I understand that in the movie Eternals the Character was recast as female, but when tried to research the comic character,  the most recent references I find online tell me that the character died in a previous story arc.

Given that death is really just a temporary inconvenience for most Eternals I am sure they just did the standard ""OH look, yet another character back from the dead"" and explained the gender issue as a minor detail change like a Time Lord's regeneration.   

Does anyone know when they changed Ajak's gender in the comics?  I just want to see so I can know when it changed with respect to the release of the movie.

In terms of writing, this could be any given show aimed at teenagers. The statement ""it's not the brown girl from Jersey City saving the world"" feels less apt though. I mean, technically she's right, but it's the brown girl from central Africa, and another one from Egypt, and a brown Jewish guy from somewhere in like Eastern USA, and there's a wildly diverse group of people in Ant Man, and they don't all put on the suit but they've contributed to saving the world at one point or another- that statement would be really strong in 2012, I don't know about 2022. 

I like how good they were at showing language and culture in a way that didn't feel isolated. This is a family that lives in New Jersey from India, but it's not a show where the only people are Muslim Urdu speakers, it's a show that depicts a minority family that hasn't cultural isolated themselves.

I just don’t see how western audiences would enjoy the show. But please tell me otherwise."

1654728394,lord_of_memeingtown,A Question about Moon Knight's Jewish representation in the MCU,"I'm going to start off by saying I loved Moon Knight and all the shows and movies I'm gonna mention.

In Black panther, a big part of the film was exploring and referencing sub-Saharan African and black culture and it was a big reason why it resonated so well with audiences, with Ms. Marvel ep1 we can see that a big part of the show is going to be revolving round Pakistani and Muslim culture (and I love it I think it gives her character depth). so why then when Marvel uses it's Jewish characters do they re-write them as white instead of Jewish (eg. spiderman, scarlet witch)?

When Moon Knight was announced I thought there's no way they can write all his roots out, and I was right (Kind of). They re-wrote why he has DID, not because of anti-Semitic attacks, not because he watched his synagogue burn down but because his mother beat him as a child. They wrote-out a big driving force of his character, being a Jew who serves an Egyptian god. The only real reference we got to his Jewish roots was that his mother had a funeral and if you squint he can sometimes be seen wearing a star of David.

there was that one scene when Layla was asked if she was an Egyptian superhero (which by the way again loved it, thought it fit the character perfectly as well as completing some form of arc about her relationship with Egypt) that summed the whole thing up perfectly, why wasn't there a Jewish moment like that? Why was moon Knight written to be solely an exploration of Egypt and not be Jewish the same way as Ms. Marvel or black panther, or even Egypt in moon knight? Why do Jewish characters always get whitewashed?

The world saw an increasing population of scary and powerful people as a threat, several extermination plots were prevented as Professor X and his merry band of students and helpers tried to convince the world that mutant-kind was not a threat, while Magneto and his side tried to take things over with mutants as a superior race.

1654663478,ArugulaGazebo,Is there anywhere left for the MCU to explore conceptually?,"Hey everyone,

It should go without saying that I love the MCU movies and I'm not trying to critique.

I kind of have an existential concern for the franchise. Part of what made the MCU movies so appealing to non-comic book fan audiences, besides just being great movies in general, was that the movies did a great job of adapting comic book style story telling into movie format (foreshadowing, cross overs, serialized stories, ""events,"" etc.). This type of story telling was immensly well received, climaxing with Endgame, which I think is an appitome of the type of comic story telling they had been doing. Foreshadowing and building towards ""event movies"" (you could say) is something unique to this series and what has kept movie fans invested for all those years during the Infinity Saga.

The problem is how many different types of events can you do without becoming redundant? Like if Marvel decided to build towards another big baddie essentially an analog for Thanos, like God Doom or maybe even Kang, I don't think people would care as much. It would inevitably just be compared to Infinity War and Endgame. I guess unless the stakes of the story were pretty different.

I feel like the most comic story tropes have been used already, because there has already been such a great variety of stories already told in the MCU, conceptually is there much else to explore with these comic style stories?

I am kind of doubtful. Even with superhero comics we see the stories usually follow certain tropes and storylines. The interesting ones have variations, but it is kind of similar nonetheless and the people that really enjoy these stories become the comic book fans. When this happens (some may think it already has) with the movies, the perception among movie fans probably will be that the next upcoming film is just another ""marvel movie"" instead of the next exciting blockbuster film!

What can they do about this? Not sure if they can recapture the magic of the Infinity Saga again, but they can keep creating quality films. Maybe get experimental like how some comics are, recent films have kind of been doing this. Does that defeat the purpose of having an interconnected series? Kind of, but the movies can't be propped up with that as the gimmick.

I hope they can continue their success in bringing crazy comic book concepts and stories to the big screen! Including some more awesome event movies. I was hoping for a House of M Avengers movie, as I thought that would be unique enough and Elizabeth Olsen is a great actress, but I doubt we are getting that now because we kind of already did get it. Secret Invasion could be really tense, but there are some similarities to Winter Solder. Original Sin could be a good way to do an event but keep it character centric?

God bless if you read through my rambly thoughts. I got thinking about this because I am excited for the upcoming Thor movie, but have not been as interested in the Disney+ stuff and some of the phase 4 movies. I'm not expecting cinema history to be broken with Thor 4, but I like Chris Hemsworth's take and I am hoping to see more of the Norse mythology stuff from the comics in it. Ultimately, I think this will be the forseeable future of the MCU's appeal, more individual character centric.

TLDR:
I feel like adaptation of comic book story telling to film is what made the MCU uniquely appealing and got people excited to follow along as we hadn't seen that with films before. But that can't be a selling point forever or else it becomes a gimmick which defeats some of the purpose of the MCU. Instead they should focus on just making good superhero movies. Superhero stories have their tropes and usually follow similar plots, so unfortunately it might just be considered more of the same and just another ""marvel movie,"" then superhero movies might become kind of niche again. But I hope Marvel can continue their success in making new movies with events or C-D list characters and make them unique and compelling enough to be popular.",1,"Is there anywhere left for the MCU to explore conceptually?

1654396924,thefinkinthesink,Question about Immortal X-Men #1,"So just finished, and I thiiiink I get the twist with Moira at the end generally, but wanted to address some lingering questions.

Future Sinister learns something past Sinister needs to know. He uploads the info to a Moira clone, kills a Moira clone, and then Sinister activates the X-gene from a baby Moira (or several?) to get the info, Sinister downloads it, and he knows what happens in the future. 

So, my questions are as follows:

1) Are these future Sinisters done when the Moira clone dies? Does the timeline essentially collapse and end with her death, or it is essentially like Sinister claps his hands and says ""I know that'll come in handy for past me!"" and keep going?

2) If he is getting information from future timelines that end once Moira dies, wouldn't he receive all the information immediately once he first set up this game of Moira Telephone?

To give some context (can skip down to where it says **\*SKIP\*** if you don't care), I am in the process of physically collecting all the most important and significant of the classic X-Men comics to fill out the important details of their 616 continuity and put it in chronological order. And, some of them are even more modern retellings of either already told or untold stories.  


In chronological order, they are: X-Men Season One, Dark Phoenix Saga, Days of Future Past, God Loves Man Kills, Mutant Massacre... and, well, the Age of Apocalypse Omnibus most recently, after saving up money for that monstrosity.

So either way, I have already been skimming through the pages of X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse, and read up the plot synopsis and stuff like that... and I realize it's set in ""a twisted version of the world they knew"", Earth-295... and, it's about Bishop fixing the timeline to get back to Earth-616 again?  


So... it's like Flashpoint of DC Comics, but instead of Flash it's Bishop? In other words, absolutely NOTHING happens in this comic that matters to 616 continuity, other than maybe the fact that Bishop remembers it all?  


The reason I am confused about this is because I've been told COUNTLESS of times that X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse is THE definitive Apocalypse story to demonstrate what type of character he is, what his background is, and what his powers are. Have I been decieved?  


I would really, REALLY appreciate people's inputs on this. It's bad enough that it's a ridiculously huge omnibus that feels daunting to get into, and it's also bad enough that it's filled with bad 90s artwork - but now I also hesitate to even read it because it doesn't seem like anything in it even matters.

I'm curious if I'm one of a few or if more felt the same as the majority do praise it and love Hickman's work, ironically i feel much like our fave mutants and an outcast when it comes to x books now.

The whole dying and reincarnation is one thing that bothers me, more so when we've had past x stories dealing with the after life, makes it feel (to me) that the reincarnations are more lile clones and my fave mutants are probably dead.

I'm curious if I'm one of a few or if more felt the same as the majority do praise it and love Hickman's work, ironically i feel much like our fave mutants and an outcast when it comes to x books now.

The whole dying and reincarnation is one thing that bothers me, more so when we've had past x stories dealing with the after life, makes it feel (to me) that the reincarnations are more lile clones and my fave mutants are probably dead.

1654275944,MagicJoshByGosh,Unpopular opinion: I wish Marvel deaths were permanent,"Well, okay, let me elaborate: I wish character deaths in Marvel Comics were permanent *for the most part.* I mean, yeah, in a few cases it makes sense for the character to come back, I get it. But a lot of the best storylines involve a main character dying — Death of Spider-Man, Dark Phoenix Saga, Death of Captain Marvel, The Night Gwen Stacy Died, and many others included. All of those stories I listed involve someone (Ultimate Spider-Man, Jean Grey, Mar-Vell the original Captain Marvel, Gwen Stacy and Norman Osborn) being killed for real. The only characters that came back were Jean and Norman, and they came back after *at least* a couple decades.

No, this is not me saying that I wish Captain America’s assassination at the end of Civil War was permanent. I’m saying I wish it didn’t happen.

Now, again, I will agree that there are a select few storylines that benefit from a character being resurrected, or a retcon rewriting their death as “being teleported to the Negative Zone,” or “I faked my death to protect you from harm,” or whatever weird explanation they give. Hell, even the Clone Saga brought back Gwen for a second saying that she was actually a clone. But I wish those cases were few and far between.

That’s one of the reasons why I think the Ultimate Universe is under-appreciated. Most everyone’s deaths in the Ultimate Universe were permanent. Death had an impact on the story because it was an *actual* threat. I like that kind of story.

Warning beforehand: I haven't read the comics, I looked over his wiki, and it encouraged me to write this.

The Scarlet Witch, while tearing through the Illuminati in a magic-child-induced rage, engaged in conversation with Mr. Fantastic (which shouldn'tve happened, and seemed out of character for her since she was already in that deep), who explained that black bolt could easily destroy her with a single word, which is completely true.

He, for some reason, flexes and smiles. LITERALLY WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?? That is so out of character for him! He literally never acts cocky any other time, even apologizing while killing alternate Dr. Strange!

Wanda asks, ""what mouth?"", revealing that she has removed his mouth from existence, which first of all was shocking and interesting, but then HE SCREAMS. This is what gets me. He understands the power of his ability, and never speaks any other time, even at emotional provocation, but just yells 'cause why not.

It may even be the first time they'll show a Cosmic entity like Eternity (more powerful than the Celestials that created the Eternals) to deal with Dormammu.  


Eventually the only safe place for Clea would be Earth where she'll lose her magic then study in the Sanctum Sanctorum to find a way to regain them.

1657918759,godzillavkk,What is your favorite and least favorite adaptational origin change?,"Every superhero adaptation takes liberties, and origins are a common thing to change for better or worse. On this thread, list what adaptational origin you liked best, and which one you hated most of all. And why one worked and why the other did not.

Both of mine involved then hero's parent not being whom they thought they were. 

Best: Batman the Telltale Game. In this episodic game retelling of  Batman's early career, Bruce Wayne learns a horrifying secret about his family. Thomas and Martha Wayne, had ties to the mob and worked with Carmine Falcone and Hamilton Hill. Wayne Enterprises was also a greedy  and amoral corporation that did all the terrible things that real world  corporations do to people and the planet. One day however, Thomas went too far and Martha(who had at least a little bit more standards)  threatened to leave him and take Bruce with her. Thomas soon began to  start thinking about leaving crime behind. But when Mayor Hill found out  about this, he feared Thomas would become a security risk, and hired a  thug named Joe Chill to murder him.

There are a number of reasons why this works for me. The first is because this change allows Batman to keep going strong in the changing world today, as our views of the rich are not as glamorous as they used to be. This also shows how Bruce was never corrupted by the power and wealth he was born into. This also serves as a catalyst of why he is Batman. Because some of the members of his rogues gallery in this continuity, became villains because of Thomas Wayne. So Bruce sees being Batman as correcting his fathers crimes. And finally, this solves a minor issue I have with Batman's origin. Thomas and Martha Wayne were two of the most respected and loved citizens of Gotham. If they were killed in a mugging, it would be all over the news and the murderer would have nowhere to run. But if Chill was a paid hitman who had friends in the Mob, they could protect him when the cops would come looking for him. And it shows gamers and audiences what kind of corruption plagues the world of the elite.

Now for my most hated origin change. Shazam 2019. I once never thought one slip-up could ruin a whole movie. This movie proved me wrong. When Billy Batson finally meets his biological mother, he finds out that she abandoned him due to being unwilling to care for him, and as punishment, she now lives in a poor apartment, with a minimum wage job, and abusive boyfriend. She also reveals that she was kicked out of home due to a teen pregnancy and her boyfriend was incarcerated. She also shows no love for the boy. The whole reason this scene exists, is so that Billy will accept his adoptive family as his real one. And they did a terrible job of doing it.

Why this does not work? Where to begin? I know what she did was wrong, but what Billy doesn't get, and what the movie does not show, was that both he and his mother were screwed over by the system that the Telltale Thomas Wayne ran. Homelessness is caused by things like poverty, long term unemployment, desperation, bias against the homeless, and even disasters, all of which are caused by capitalism. I don't think she would have abandoned him had she not been screwed over. There's a much greater evil at work in that scene, but the movie and Billy refused to show or see it, and the narrative does something that capitalism does, blame poverty, hardship, and misery on the poor and downtrodden. I would have expected a poor orphan like Billy Batson to know what it's like to live under an unfair system that can make people desperate enough to do terrible things, given that he's supposed to be even kinder then Superman. While I initially applauded the movie for it's themes of there is no such thing as pure of heart, maybe it needed Billy to be pure of heart. And it served no purpose apart from appreciating his adopted family. There are much better ways to show it, but that's all it does. It doesn't serve as a catalyst him to be a better hero, and it shifts the blame from a fixed system to a victim of it. And by doing that, it does the audience no favors. Not to mention that with Roe V Wade overturned, this hurts a lot more.

1657878124,Wonderful_Chain_9680,Green Lantern Beware my Power. Spoilers ahead Maybe,"The movie was okay, it’s carried a lot by its animation. Like of all the new DCAMU movies this one has the best fight scenes, in my opinion. I loved the reference to the JLU universe by the inclusion of both Shayera and Mari. Green arrow also seems to be the best part of the movie. The inclusion of Adam Strange was interesting and I’m going to go read Strange Adventures, as he never really had an impact on Young Justice. But that’s pretty much where my praises end. 

How much you enjoy this movie is based on whichever Green Lantern you grew up with that is to say, I grew up with John so my feelings about the movie are much on a lighter side. Also your comic book knowledge also applies to whether or not you will enjoy this movie.

The voice acting especially on the part of Aldis as John is rather stiff, like in some parts it felt like they were righting John Stewart to be slow.  Khary Payton or even Brandon Michael Hall from the Injustice games would have been a better pick in my opinion. Also as much as I love Nolan North his voice ≠ Hal Jordan ,or I’m too used to him as the Ghost from Destiny or Superboy from Young Justice-so really that could be a me issue and shouldn’t be taken to heart in the review, he also has the best performance in the movie 

Others who watched the movie complained about boring sound effects but really that didn’t bother me. But it’s the impact of some scenes that are kinda stiff, for example there’s a Kamikaze scene in the movie, that just happens like I’m sitting there shocked while for the characters it just happens, also they don’t even try to stop they just watch it happen. All so it gets boring in some parts

But all in all okay movie.

1657851393,Wonderful_Chain_9680,What are some ways you think DC can make a comeback,"My suggestions and opinions you can disagree or add on no hate:

1. Better use of their animation team, Kingdom Come, Injustice, more recent Dark Knights of steel all of these limited series could be made into multiple season tv shows or movies. DC has ties with studio mir (Studio behind You g Justice and the legend of Korra and OLM (Behind Pokémon) utilizing them properly could lead to bigger revenue, Imagine a 5 season Injustice Animated venture, animated with fight choreography on par with the legend of Korra or even by Mappa that would be amazing, especially with the popularity of evil Superman ( I also don’t like this trope however think with your wallets that’s what’s popular right now)

2. Much more cohesive and permanent storytelling, the reason why manga is at the top is because of the writing and investment, when I invest time into One Punch Man for example I get my payoff once a decision has been made it’s over it’s done no take backs. One thing about comic books is nothing matters, Joker war I was expecting something more I thought they were gonna keep the joker out permanently, nope he got away.

3. Cinematic Universe: DCs movies post Josstice League have been really good, in general Peacemaker is better than most of the MCU shows, but they jumped the gun in their execution. Water Hamada is good, but taking full advantage of HBO Max would be perfect the way the movies are spaced perfect they just need to keep up their quality aspect of their movies, this would be perfect.

4. Better digital availability, comixology sucks to the point in just forego buying comic books in general. Marvel has the marvel app and I have to go all the way to Sauga, to buy comics here in Ontario and they didn’t even have the latest issues 

5. Put the spotlight, on your c-D list characters I love Batman, but give other characters the spotlight, Aquaman is the highest grossing DC Movie, not the Batman, not man of steel, not Joker. Aquaman, do more Im hyped for Black Adam, cus I know it’s gonna be good.

Now Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Shazam, and Supergirl are a part of the Justice League. The Justice League will have Lex Luthor, Joker, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Deathstroke, Black Manta, Cheetah, and General Zod In the legion of doom. They will fight I guess. Justice League wins. (just imagine the fun plot)

&amp;#x200B;

The Flash 3

Flash fights godspeed. And flash dies so Wally West becomes the new flash.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League Dark

It will have the story where the enchantress didn’t really die and defeats the justice league, so Madame Xanadu forms the justice league dark to take her down. (The team will have Constantine, Zatanna, Deadman, Madame Xanadu and The Changing Man.)  (and maybe mindwarp)

(sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

Blue beetle 2

(sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

The Justice Society Of America 

The Members of the J.S.A would be Jay Garrick's Flash, Alan Scotts Green Lantern, Atom Smasher, Powergirl, Hour Man, Doctor Fate and the Spectre. It would hint at a crisis on infinite earth's movie.

&amp;#x200B;

The Green Lanterns

This movie would have Hal Jordan being retired and Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, and Guy Gardner all being green lanterns. The Story will be darkest night/ brightest day. The Villain will resurrect Deathstroke, The Flash, Copperhead and a bunch of others. (the flash and batman are resurrected from the whole white lantern thing, but no other heroes were resurrected) (Simon Was recruited to help fight Nekron, and Jessica had her backstory inbetween movies.)

&amp;#x200B;

The Justice Society Of America 2

This movie will have Stargirl, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Cyclone, Doctor Mid-Nite and Sandman join the J.S.A. The Villain could be some weird earth 2 legion of doom.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman: Val Zod 

This movie is also on earth 2. This Movie would be about Him and Powergirl fighting brutaal. But for the finer details of the plot, sorry iddkdkdkdkdkdk.

&amp;#x200B;

The New Teen Titans

After a while, The Teen Titans split. Now Damian Started a new version with Superboy, And Bart Allen. (Superboy and Damian don’t like each other very much but everybody likes Bart) I know I've said it a million times but, for the plot, IDKKKK.

&amp;#x200B;

Arsenal (Tv Show)

This Would be a show about green arrow training arsenal to be his successor. And black canary is in this.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths part 1

I'll just put everything on part 2 

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths part 2

Since I haven’t read many comics, I don’t know this story. But I do know the general idea. You Know, alternate earth characters come to Earth one/prime/whatever, the anti-monitor is the villain, blah blah blah. For Deaths though, Guy Gardner, Green Arrow, and Supergirl are the main ones. From Earth two, Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Sandman die.

Booster gold 3

&amp;#x200B;

Aqualad 

Apologies 

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder Girl

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Beetle 3

:///////

&amp;#x200B;

Cyborg

Since the old teen titans Split, Beast-Boy and Cyborg are just kinda there. Another filler movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Green Lanterns: The Far Sector

A Sojourner Mullein movie, and also Teen Lantern. In this movie they both just kinda do whatever. There is a part about the Orange Lanterns, and other one off sh!t.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League 8 (Young Justice or Legion of Super-Heroes)

Superman (superboy) Damian Wayne as Batman, Aqualad, Wonder Girl, Kid Flash (Bart), Nightwing, Cassandra Cain’s Batgirl, Raven, Cyborg, Beast-Boy, Blue-Beetle, Arsenal, Teen Lantern, Terra, Stargirl and Shazam are apart of the new Justice League. The Main Villains are the crime syndicate who came to earth prime during Crisis on Infinite earths. (most of the former justice league villains and earth 2 j.s.a characters are in this too but not the focus.

&amp;#x200B;

Explaining Some Stuff

Now Superman (Clark Kent) Isn’t really doing hero stuff anymore, The same goes for Barry Allen, Hal Jordan, and a couple of other characters. (If they don’t appear prominently in the new movies just assume that's what happened.) And Val-Zod is now being superman along with Jon Kent and Power-Girl. (kinda) And for Batman characters, Bruce isn’t doing Batman, Dick Grayson is Nightwing, Tim Drake is Batman and Damian is a young Batman (like 15-16 years old), Barbara Gordon isn’t being Batgirl anymore, and Cassandra Cain is.

&amp;#x200B;

Birds Of Prey 3

The Joker Is still doing stupid shit. And Pisses off the birds of prey. And blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, Joker ends up falling off a building and dying.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman: Val Zod 2

Idk about this movie sorrryryryryryryryryyryryryry. (Red Tornado is in it tho so that's cool.)

&amp;#x200B;

The New Gods

://///////////////////////////////////////////////

&amp;#x200B;

Aqualad 2

The villain is somebody, maybe siren idk.

&amp;#x200B;

Elseworld (Tv Show)

This is a live action show about Elseworld comics (obviously). Kind of like the “What If?” show but live action.

Episodes:

1. Batman: Gotham by Gaslight

2. Superman: Red Son

3. Justice League: The Nail

4. Kingdom Come

5. Dceased

6. Batman: In Darkest Night

7. All-Star Superman

8. Injustice: Gods Among Us part. 1

9. Injustice: Gods Among Us part. 2

&amp;#x200B;

The New Superman

Jon Kent is superman. The villain can be Amazo (It should be Kid Amazo but I haven’t done the first Amazo yet so idk.)

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder-Girl: Power of the Gods

(Donna Troy was Wonder-Girl in both of the movies btw.)

This movie is really good. The story would be about Wonder-Girl and Wonder-Woman fighting the Greek gods for some reason and Diana learning about her being a god sorta and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I’ll Keep going idk.

Just the wonder woman movie from real life (will have aquaman after credits scene)

&amp;#x200B;

Green Lantern

The Real life movie, but better.

&amp;#x200B;

Kind of like Zack Snyder's Justice League, except cyborg isn't in it. Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter are a part of the team. And the movie is a bit more funny. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aquaman

Just the real life movie

&amp;#x200B;

Shazam

Just the real life movie

&amp;#x200B;

The Dark Knight

Just the dark knight but with references to the justice league and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League vs. Legion Of Doom

Now Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Shazam, and Supergirl are a part of the Justice League. The Justice League will have Lex Luthor, Joker, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Deathstroke, Black Manta, Cheetah, and General Zod In the legion of doom. They will fight I guess. Justice League wins. (just imagine the fun plot)

&amp;#x200B;

Robin Begins

The origin of Robin because cool. (Batman is obviously in it.)

&amp;#x200B;

Green Lantern 2

The Sinestro Corp War. It will have John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner becoming Green Lanterns. (it sounds like a lot for one movie but we’ll make it work.)

Nightwing. Sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Plastic Man

Justice League 3

Kind of a filler story, just imagine this movie. Kid Flash, Plastic Man and The Atom also join the Justice League.

The Dark Knight Rises

Will be different from the real life version. Batman doesn’t die, Nightwing is here, and Barbara Gordon as Batgirl is here too. (and Tim Drake's robin)

&amp;#x200B;

Birds Of Prey

Will be the real life movie, but Batgirl and Green Arrow are here too.

&amp;#x200B;

The Flash 3

Flash fights godspeed. And flash dies so Wally West becomes the new flash.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League Dark

It will have the story where the enchantress didn’t really die and defeats the justice league, so Madame Xanadu forms the justice league dark to take her down. (The team will have Constantine, Zatanna, Deadman, Madame Xanadu and The Changing Man.)  (and maybe mindwarp)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League Apokolips War Part 2

Idkkk other than they beat Darkseid, Batman &amp; Plastic-Man die, Mr. Miracle and the other new gods helped the Justice League, and the movie was good. (idk much about this story im sorryyy.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Booster Gold 2

(sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

Blue beetle 2

(sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

The Justice Society Of America 

The Members of the J.S.A would be Jay Garrick's Flash, Alan Scotts Green Lantern, Atom Smasher, Powergirl, Hour Man, Doctor Fate and the Spectre. It would hint at a crisis on infinite earth's movie.

&amp;#x200B;

The Green Lanterns

This movie would have Hal Jordan being retired and Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, and Guy Gardner all being green lanterns. The Story will be darkest night/ brightest day. The Villain will resurrect Deathstroke, The Flash, Copperhead and a bunch of others. (the flash and batman are resurrected from the whole white lantern thing, but no other heroes were resurrected) (Simon Was recruited to help fight Nekron, and Jessica had her backstory inbetween movies.)

&amp;#x200B;

Booster Gold 2

Sorrryryryry

&amp;#x200B;

Doom Patrol 2

Sorry

The Flash 4

A Bart Allen story and has flash not do much flash stuff anymore. (kinda like retiring but not really) Idk much for the villain or anything like that.

Superman &amp; Superboy 

Will be the origin for Superboy. Idk anything for the villains and all that. (it will have a damian wayne after credit scene)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Justice Society Of America 2

This movie will have Stargirl, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Cyclone, Doctor Mid-Nite and Sandman join the J.S.A. The Villain could be some weird earth 2 legion of doom.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman: Val Zod 

This movie is also on earth 2. This Movie would be about Him and Powergirl fighting brutaal. But for the finer details of the plot, sorry iddkdkdkdkdkdk.

&amp;#x200B;

The New Teen Titans

After a while, The Teen Titans split. Now Damian Started a new version with Superboy, And Bart Allen. (Superboy and Damian don’t like each other very much but everybody likes Bart) I know I've said it a million times but, for the plot, IDKKKK.

&amp;#x200B;

Arsenal (Tv Show)

This Would be a show about green arrow training arsenal to be his successor. And black canary is in this.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths part 1

I'll just put everything on part 2 

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths part 2

Since I haven’t read many comics, I don’t know this story. But I do know the general idea. You Know, alternate earth characters come to Earth one/prime/whatever, the anti-monitor is the villain, blah blah blah. For Deaths though, Guy Gardner, Green Arrow, and Supergirl are the main ones. From Earth two, Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Sandman die.

&amp;#x200B;

Booster gold 3

I'm so sorry, iddk.

&amp;#x200B;

Aqualad 

Apologies 

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder Girl

:/

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Beetle 3

:///////

&amp;#x200B;

Cyborg

Since the old teen titans Split, Beast-Boy and Cyborg are just kinda there. Another filler movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Green Lanterns: The Far Sector

A Sojourner Mullein movie, and also Teen Lantern. In this movie they both just kinda do whatever. There is a part about the Orange Lanterns, and other one off sh!t.

&amp;#x200B;

Justice League 8 (Young Justice or Legion of Super-Heroes)

Superman (superboy) Damian Wayne as Batman, Aqualad, Wonder Girl, Kid Flash (Bart), Nightwing, Cassandra Cain’s Batgirl, Raven, Cyborg, Beast-Boy, Blue-Beetle, Arsenal, Teen Lantern, Terra, Stargirl and Shazam are apart of the new Justice League. The Main Villains are the crime syndicate who came to earth prime during Crisis on Infinite earths. (most of the former justice league villains and earth 2 j.s.a characters are in this too but not the focus.

&amp;#x200B;

Explaining Some Stuff

Now Superman (Clark Kent) Isn’t really doing hero stuff anymore, The same goes for Barry Allen, Hal Jordan, and a couple of other characters. (If they don’t appear prominently in the new movies just assume that's what happened.) And Val-Zod is now being superman along with Jon Kent and Power-Girl. (kinda) And for Batman characters, Bruce isn’t doing Batman, Dick Grayson is Nightwing, Tim Drake is Batman and Damian is a young Batman (like 15-16 years old), Barbara Gordon isn’t being Batgirl anymore, and Cassandra Cain is.

&amp;#x200B;

Birds Of Prey 3

The Joker Is still doing stupid shit. And Pisses off the birds of prey. And blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, Joker ends up falling off a building and dying.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman: Val Zod 2

Idk about this movie sorrryryryryryryryryyryryryry. (Red Tornado is in it tho so that's cool.)

&amp;#x200B;

The New Gods

://///////////////////////////////////////////////

&amp;#x200B;

Aqualad 2

The villain is somebody, maybe siren idk.

&amp;#x200B;

Elseworld (Tv Show)

This is a live action show about Elseworld comics (obviously). Kind of like the “What If?” show but live action.

Episodes:

1. Batman: Gotham by Gaslight

2. Superman: Red Son

3. Justice League: The Nail

4. Kingdom Come

5. Dceased

6. Batman: In Darkest Night

7. All-Star Superman

8. Injustice: Gods Among Us part. 1

9. Injustice: Gods Among Us part. 2

&amp;#x200B;

The New Superman

Jon Kent is superman. The villain can be Amazo (It should be Kid Amazo but I haven’t done the first Amazo yet so idk.)

&amp;#x200B;

Wonder-Girl: Power of the Gods

(Donna Troy was Wonder-Girl in both of the movies btw.)

This movie is really good. The story would be about Wonder-Girl and Wonder-Woman fighting the Greek gods for some reason and Diana learning about her being a god sorta and all that.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I’ll Keep going idk.

Thank you for reading all this garbage!!! (:

* [**Checkmate**](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HFN65KYeL.jpg), by Greg Rucka and Jesus Saiz 

Set after the controversial events of Infinite Crisis, Checkmate picks up right after Maxwell Lord’s death and the disbandment of the titular organization. When the group’s purpose and necessity are called into question, the United Nations reworks the team’s structure to demonstrate the capabilities of such an operation. Using the ""Rule of Two"",  the team is divided into sets of joint partnerships between human and metahuman leaders. With members such as Sasha Bordeaux, Mister Terrific, Fire, and Alan Scott, Checkmate acts as intelligence intervention tasked with establishing and maintaining order.

There’s a YouTube channel called Overly Sarcastic Productions and they put a thing out on Superman, and I learned that Superman never wants to kill people. It reminded me of a song Pete Seeger wrote that went “I learned that murderers die for the crime / even if we make a mistake sometimes” so it seems like the death penalty was hotly debated at the time. In many US states it’s still legal.

Were comic books filled with political satire like this?

1657667655,Some-Dog9800,I'm working on a fanfic project with my brother. Can y'all help us decide on a villain?,"The story is divided into several ongoing arcs which build up to a massive Endgame-level finale. One story arc is designated for each corner of the DC universe, nonpowered street-level heroes, more cosmic superheroes, mainly the Green Lanterns, and the mystical side with heroes like Zatanna and Dr. Fate. The nonpowered heroes primarily face the the League of Assassins and the splinter factions which developed following the death of Ra's Al Ghul as they engage in their Shadow War. Talia Al Ghul is the main villain of this arc, and the finale has heroes like Batman and Green Arrow going up against Leviathan. The cosmic superheroes like the Green Lanterns mostly tie into the Darkest Hour, the eventual crisis event of this timeline in which a threat will rise from Earth-4 (the fourth world of the 52), enabled by the weakening of the walls separating each universe due to the death of one of Earth's Ten Paragons. But I'm struggling to come up with a threat for the mystical heroes to combat. I've narrowed it down to either the Queen of Fables, Eclipso, Hecate, or Morgan le Fay. I'm leaning more towards Hecate or Morgan because they could both be set up in prior entries with appearances from Circe and Etrigan respectively. But I wanted some outside opinions. Is there anyone else I could use that isn't listed?

1657556587,ImaFireSquid,Some deconstructions of DC comics rated based on if they had anything interesting to say,"There are so many. It's almost always superman or the Justice League, but I've read and watched quite a few, so here are some of the more popular ones.

This is my opinion. This is not objective truth. Art doesn't have objective truth. Some people pay millions for a green block. Others pay pennies for intricate Chinese woven paintings. The world is weird.

**Harley Quinn- 9/10**

What if Harley had complex emotions and we dredged up a bunch of random underused supervillains and made them tremendously dysfunctional? I dig it. It doesn't immediately go ""DC but dark"", it goes ""DC but chaotic"" and I respect that. The actual moral seems to be about gaining a sense of self-worth, which isn't a bad way to go at all.

**The Watchmen- 8/10**

The moral seems to be ""when you get too big and powerful, you lose track of the most important parts of life."" Remakes don't always focus on that as much though, and instead focus on how cool Rorsach is. And to be fair, Rorsach is very cool. It's been added into DC comics now so it's not even a DC parody anymore. It's just a DC thing.

**The Boys- 8/10**

Seems to be a statement about corporations dehumanizing individuals for a profit. Good characters, and the show has a very different trajectory than the comics but neither sucks. Solid Justice League parody. The characters are aesthetically the justice league, and when you first see them they look like the justice league, but as the story progresses they veer so far off that it becomes a totally different work.

**Invincible- 5/10**

What if Superman was evil aaaand killed the Justice League? The concept isn't mind blowing, but evil Superman training his son is a decent premise for a story about lots of gore and angst.

**Man of Steel- 4/10**

""What if Superman had to kill somebody?"" asks the guy who forgot what Superman's whole deal was. We jumped into a theoretical ""Superman's darkest hour"" while neither developing the character nor dealing with the consequences of that choice. Decent opening act though.

**Brightburn- 2/10**

What if Superman was evil? Wouldn't that be bad? Yes it would. Literally nobody is questioning whether an evil Superman would be a bad thing. They tried to tease an evil Justice League series too. Very ambitious for a show with the most simple question and answer ever. The eyeball scene was gross.",0,"Some deconstructions of DC comics rated based on if they had anything interesting to say There are so many.

1657485542,Mykk6788,Convince me otherwise: Jason Todd should be the Next Batman,"Before I start, I want to get the big Elephant out of the room asap. I don't have a problem with Jace Fox's Batman, nor do I have a problem with there being a ""Black Batman"". There already were throughout the Multiverse for years. DC has moved Jace to NY so I'm talking about a Batman for Gotham.

Now that that's out of the way, let me explain my reasoning why. First off this is more of a hypothetical. If Bruce didn't return after Dark Crisis, or if Bruce decided his Justice League duties needed to come first, or any other reason for Bruce's absence happened.

Next we list out all the potential folks who have properly earned the right to take up the mantle next and look into each:

- Nightwing (Dick Grayson)

- Red Robin (Tim Drake)

- Robin (Damian Wayne)

- Red Hood (Jason Todd)

Nightwing:
The obvious first choice, as without Bruce being counted, has literally been Batman more than the others. The problem though lies with motivation, character and Legacy. Dick has never been motivated to take over as Batman from Bruce. Halfway through being Robin he knew he didn't want to. His character doesn't fit with Batman either, it's akin to casting a charismatic actor in a role as an unfeeling emotionless character. Nightwings whole thing is cracking jokes and lightening the mood even with bullets flying over his head. Then there's Legacy, the Nightwing hero moniker is one of the rare Legacy characters that folks who aren't hugely familiar with DC have still heard of or know of. He's earned the right to be as known as any DC Character over the years.

Red Robin:
Best Detective of the bunch and a whizz at tech. But Drake has seen what kind of Batman he could become thanks to Jor El. Ever since then he's been adamant to distance himself from becoming Batman as much as possible, even changing his hero name to Drake at one point, which luckily DC had the sense to even mock recently. He just doesn't want it.

Robin:
Damien Wayne started out as an annoying brat everyone wanted to die. But by the time he did die, he was one of the most interesting characters in the Batfamily and everyone wanted him back. I honestly think he'd make a great Batman. In the future. But he's just too young. I think the comics have him at age 14 right now, so he literally couldn't be a Bat-MAN yet.

Red Hood:
The original brat everyone hated and wanted dead. And then they goy to vote on it and he did. But when he returned as Red Hood it not only gave us a great story, but a great new complex character to find out about. Villain to anti-hero to hero back to anti-hero. Jason's been thrown around DC a lot over the years simply because he has no direction. It's because of everything above that I think he'd make a great Batman with some fantastic story ideas. Him and Bruce are at each others throats every weekend yet in an emergency he always shows up, as long as he can.

The way I imagined it is Bruce has left Video Messages for each Batfamily member. Jason's is the last, and although it starts off with Bruce lecturing him about killing and guns, it turns into a challenge. Bruce explains that when Jason returned he told Bruce he could clean up Gotham better than him. Bruce challenges Jason to do this as Batman. ""No guns, no killing, you wanted to prove you could clean up Gotham better, so be better"". ""This is your one and only chance to finally prove you meant what you said, and to harness that darkness I know is inside you, as it was with me, and use it to make every street thug, monster and villain fear the name Batman again"".

Jason would make mistakes. Realise he had a lot of assumptions about being Batman that are being proven incorrect with every single day. Realise that Bruce never truly did this on his own with Alfred and the Robins around and so push himself to ask the Batfamily for help. Most of all he'd struggle with defining ""Justice"", as his previous alterego preferred killing rather than looking to rehabilitate. Theres lots of Batman stories that could be told with Jason under the cowl that just couldn't be told with Bruce. Jason knows living on the streets, he can eventually sympathise and empathise.

1657451246,RhythmicCacophony,What version of the Teen Titans do you think would work best for a cinematic adaptation in a hypothetical rebooted DCEU?,"For me, I think a combination of the New Teen Titans (1980-1984) and the Teen Titans (2003-2011) would be the best choice for the big screen. Why? Well the New Teen Titans (1980-1984) are by far the most iconic and popular version of the team period. A big reason for this being that it introduced unique stories and characters that helped the team differentiate itself from the Justice League (e.g. Trigon, Judas Contract, etcetera). Thereby giving them an identity of their own instead of just having them be watered down versions of their mentors.

But why do I say that the Teen Titans (2003-2011) run should be combined with this? Well for one because I personally think Superboy should also be on the team considering how iconic he is as well as how great his origin story is what with being tied to the death of superman and all that. However, the main reason I think the Teen Titans (2003-2011) should be combined with the New Teen Titans (1980-1984) is because I think Cassie Sandsmark is a more interesting Wonder Girl who can also serve a greater purpose in helping along other hypothetical plotlines within the DCEU. For example, you could have such that after Robin becomes Nightwing he decides to leave the team in order to be with and work alongside Oracle after she was crippled, with Cassie taking leadership of the team in his stead. Something she has proven capable of doing as seen when she took charge of the team after winning the vote against Robin. Furthermore, Cassie also has a much more straightforward continuity and backstory then Donna Troy does. Thus, there would be less convolution there.

Basically my take on it is that I think that the New Teen Titans (1980-1984) is the best version of the team and most obvious choice to get a cinematic adaptation. Just with the minor edit of adding Superboy and replacing Donna Troy with Cassie Sandsmark.

With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.
        
A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.
        
**To those answering**
        
Avoid vague replies like ""yes"" or ""no"". Rather do your best to explain your answer, and if necessary provide a link that may help anyone interested in learning more. Remember to &gt;!hide spoilers!&lt; when discussing major events that have taken place within one year of its release..

1657406646,moldychipmunk,"[Discussion] Garfield Logan, the sensitive soul with a big heart","Gar Logan holds a special place in my heart for many reasons. Whether it's his enduring positivity in the face of grief and trauma, childlike joy in using his animal powers, or remaining true to his offbeat self in spite of others telling him to get serious, I've always found the character a source of comfort.

Recently I found [one of the best profiles I've seen of Gar](https://www.cbr.com/teen-titans-beast-boy-gay/), that connects some of these dots, making a case for his continued relevance and future potential. Putting aside the clickbaity title, some thoughtful points are made, and patterns emerge in how he relates to others. The key premise is:

&gt;Beast Boy is an incredibly romantic person at heart, someone who loves to love and yearns to *be* loved...  He's a sensitive soul with love for everyone in his heart.  

The author goes a step further to describe Gar as a queer-coded character. I think this is open to interpretation (I happen to agree). But at the very least, these qualities are rarely represented in male characters in comics, and to me they're quite welcome and important. Notably, the author leaves sexual attraction out of the analysis completely, focusing on the queer aspect of simply being outside the norm in how one approaches romance, platonic friendships, or expressions of love in general.

I think very few recognize this aspect of Gar, certainly not at DC. As long as grim, dark stories sell, his potential will continue to be overlooked. But I think stories with more heart - indeed, where being a cheerful goof is a super-power - would find an audience in these bleak, disconnected times.

As a peculiar sort myself, I always assumed my take on Gar existed only in my own mind, but perhaps others see it too.

1657388856,manofsteel9979,Legacy Characters shouldn't exist,"This is probably a hot take but I'll explain...

The day Bruce Wayne hangs it up, there should never be another Batman. Give the next hero his own identity. The best example of this is Nightwing.

Dick Grayson has spent almost 40 years becoming his own man with his own identity. He doesn't need the Batman name to succeed. This organic character growth should happen to all the other former Robin's. Batman is Batman because of the person underneath. The trauma the personality, the character growth. Jason Todd wearing the Batsuit, is Jason Todd, not Batman.

The same thing with Superboy. Give him his own name and identity separate from Clark. There will never ever be another Superman. Connor and/or Jon should create new identities that showcase who they are as individuals and what makes them heroes without needing to just slap an S on their chest. 

Now when it comes to Green Lanterns this would be my only real separation because the Lantern corps are set up a military organization where the name itself is more a rank than a superhero identity. Lantern of 2481 or Lantern of 7456, etc etc etc...

But instead of trying to shoehorn sidekicks into their mentors, let them instead show why they are individual and unique by giving them their own name independent of the hero they help.

1657384170,npc1979,Only 6 Titles Left from 2016 Rebirth re-launch?,"Unless I miss something, Action, Tec, Batman, Nightwing, Wonder Woman, and Flash are the only monthly books still hanging on from the 2016 Rebirth reset.

With 2021's Robin, Harley Quinn, Deathstroke, I am Batman, Future State Gotham, Green Lantern, Superman's Son, Batgirls and the anthology Batman Urban Legends there are 9 more monthly books. I enjoyed the Shadow War crossover btw Robin and Deathstroke, but most of these 9 books are terrible.

Unless I miss something, Action, Tec, Batman, Nightwing, Wonder Woman, and Flash are the only monthly books still hanging on from the 2016 Rebirth reset. (Catwoman has been running since 2018). These 6 seem consistently good reads IMO, tho Catwoman very uneven.

With 2021's Robin, Harley Quinn, Deathstroke, I am Batman, Future State Gotham, Green Lantern, Superman's Son, Batgirls and the anthology Batman Urban Legends there are 9 more monthly books. I enjoyed the Shadow War crossover btw Robin and Deathstroke, but most of these 9 books are terrible.

1657322895,bahamut_megaflare,[Character of the Month] Mister Terrific,"# [Mister Terrific](https://i.imgur.com/HIH8whR.png)

**Created by:** John Ostrander and Tom Mandrake

**First Appearance:** *The Spectre v3 #54*

**Affiliated Organizations:** Justice Society of America, Justice League of America, Checkmate, The Terrifics

**Friends/Allies:** Alan Scott (Green Lantern), Jay Garrick (Flash), Doctor Mid-Nite, Batman, Black Lightning, Sasha Bordeaux

**Strengths/Abilities:** Genius-level intellect (third smartest man in the world), T-Spheres, martial arts, olympic-level athletics, detective skills

**Overview**

**Origins**

Self proclaimed, “third smartest man in the world”, Michael Holt made his debut in the pages of The Spectre #54. With a natural inclination to learn and an aptitude for retaining extraordinary skills, Holt had already earned 14 Ph.D’s, built a sophisticated tech firm called Cyberware, and was a gold medal Olympic athlete before becoming a superhero. Holt’s heroic journey was triggered by two separate tragedies; the death of his mentally handicaped brother and the accidental death of his pregnant wife in a fatal car crash. 

Being overwhelmed with grief and maintaining a bleak outlook on life, Holt attempted to take his life, but was stopped by the Spirit of God’s Vengeance. The Spectre then showed Michael the life of Terry Sloane, otherwise known as the Golden Age hero, Mister Terrific. Inspired by Sloane’s life, Michael adopted a costume with “fair play” across the sleeves and joined the Justice Society of America as the new Mister Terrific.

**Justice Society of America**

Sometime before joining the JSA, Holt retired from the corporate world and took on a role within the company, TylerCo. In exchange for the company funding a youth center that the hero founded, he would have to become a security consultant for them in matters of industrial espionage. This is where Holt first encountered Sandy Hawkins, the JSA member known as Sand. Hawkins had lost control of his powers and became a being composed of sentient sand. TylerCo was searching for a cure for his condition and the meeting between the two heroes left Sand impressed, which prompted him to extend JSA membership to Michael.


Mister Terrific met the other team members at their headquarters and his first mission was joining an ongoing battle with Kobra. At this time, the team was faced with two exponential threats; the Kobra cult and the time-warping villain known as Extant. To deal with both enemies simultaneously, the Justice Society was divided into two teams with Mister Terrific being selected to take on the snake zealots. Holt and his half of the JSA infiltrated Blackhawk Island to rescue the captured hero Airwave, whose powers were being exploited to hijack all technology on the planet. The success of the mission led Mister Terrific to stay and embark on more operations with the team. 

When Hawkman was eventually resurrected and returned to the team, there was a new bid for leadership of the JSA. Sand was acting chairman at the time, but an aggressive Hawkman pleaded for the position. After a disagreement between the two, leadership of the Justice Society was put to a vote with Michael Holt being chosen as the new leader. As acting chairman, Holt embarked on various team adventures including an off-world battle on Thanagar, engaging in games of life or death at the hands of Roulette, time travel hijinks with Holt meeting Terry Sloan, an intense battle between fellow JSA members and Black Adam, a spiritual meeting between his deceased wife, and many more.

**Infinite Crisis / One Year Later / Checkmate / Final Crisis**

Batman’s organic and self replicating surveillance satellite system known as Brother Eye, was hijacked by Checkmate’s Black King, Maxwell Lord. Lord corrupted the artificial intelligence and began building an army of sleeper agents embedded with Brother Eye’s nano-infused technology. Known as OMACs, these agents were tasked with hunting and exterminating super powered individuals. 

As Infinite Crisis progressed, civilians were caught in the OMAC crossfire and began turning as well. Mister Terrific was selected by Batman for a team assembled for an attack on Brother Eye, as the satellite was responsible for controlling the OMACs. Holt’s role in the assault was critical as his invisibility to all technology allowed him to reach the satellite's propulsion system. From there he was able to destroy it and send it on a downward trajectory crashing down to Earth.

After the Crisis, Holt joined the reformed Checkmate as the White King's Bishop. Alan Scott was acting White King and personally selected Terrific for the recently implemented, “rule of two”. During this time, Holt was also engaged in a relationship with fellow Checkmate agent Sasha Bordeaux, who was the Black Queen. After their first mission, Scott would pass his position as White King to Terrific after he was removed from the organization for choosing not to publicly shame China by revealing they were involved with the Kobra cult. This forces Holt to relinquish his JSA chairman position.

During Final Crisis, a team consisting of Mister Terrific, Cheetah, Snapper Carr, and Sasha Bordeaux were trapped within the ruins of Checkmate headquarters. Bordeaux was utilizing her OMAC programming to temporarily shut down her bodily functions to avoid turning into a brainwashed Justifier. The team was overwhelmed and unable to rally past the Anti-Life manipulated metahumans. Before falling prey to the same fate as the former heroes hunting them, Terrific activated a new OMAC population that was programmed to obey him rather than Brother Eye, with the hopes they could protect the last few humans against the Justifiers.

From there he was able to destroy it and send it on a downward trajectory crashing down to Earth.

After the Crisis, Holt joined the reformed Checkmate as the White King's Bishop. Alan Scott was acting White King and personally selected Terrific for the recently implemented, “rule of two”. During this time, Holt was also engaged in a relationship with fellow Checkmate agent Sasha Bordeaux, who was the Black Queen. After their first mission, Scott would pass his position as White King to Terrific after he was removed from the organization for choosing not to publicly shame China by revealing they were involved with the Kobra cult. This forces Holt to relinquish his JSA chairman position.

During Final Crisis, a team consisting of Mister Terrific, Cheetah, Snapper Carr, and Sasha Bordeaux were trapped within the ruins of Checkmate headquarters. Bordeaux was utilizing her OMAC programming to temporarily shut down her bodily functions to avoid turning into a brainwashed Justifier. The team was overwhelmed and unable to rally past the Anti-Life manipulated metahumans. Before falling prey to the same fate as the former heroes hunting them, Terrific activated a new OMAC population that was programmed to obey him rather than Brother Eye, with the hopes they could protect the last few humans against the Justifiers.

1657316758,Raanor,Looking for a good DC comics podcasts that explains the universe,"Hi everybody. So I‘ve recently decided to jump into DC after mainly reading Marvel for the last couple of years. I‘m also someone that spends quite a lot of time listening to podcasts. One I‘m especially fond of is Marveling at Marvels marvels. For those that don‘t know the show: an experienced comic reader picks each episode a marvel character and explains their history to someone who has never touched a comic book. It helped me very much in better understanding the universe as it was quite overwhelming when I started reading. Now that I want to start with Dc, again I have the feeling there is a lot of background that I miss and a similar podcast could help me fill the gaps. I know the most important characters and events (I think), but it’d be great to get the bigger picture. I‘ve been searching around, but the only shows I found were either not about the comics at all or more about the latest news.

A) a free comic book day issue which included the start of 5G and included the Flash forward story from Flash #750, but the one from the FCBD version has some changes. the free comic book day issue was pulped and Bleeding cool is the only known source to own one.

B) multiple creators have revealed many things such as Superman was going to be more authoritarian which was changed in Grant Morisson's Superman and the authority, John riddley was gonna replace James Tynion as Batman writer after issue 100, and it was gonna change to 5G with Jace Fox as Batman.

C) this timeline was meant to age with real time, example: Superman and Batman would have started in the 50s/60s and would be in there 50s now which would mean they would be replaced and wonder woman would have started in World War II

1657296049,Aster1997,Visual Identity for DC characters (ex. Dick Grayson Romani representation),"TL;DR - How much can you change about a character before they are not that character anymore. Is their entire physical appearance up for grabs as long as their story and actions are not altered?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all, I have been seeing a lot of passionate discussion about ""valid"" representation of characters (in particular Dick Grayson) in regards to their cultural heritage vs. canonical/traditional depiction.

I was curious to gather some wider opinions on the matter, rather than just the ones I've been seeing in the last three posts regarding  Gabriel Larragán's artwork.

Mainly, how important is a character's visual identity compared to their identity as a whole.  
I think the discussion in those aforementioned threads was becoming very racial in nature.  


So I wanted to point some things out and find out how others feel.  
I think in comic books especially the superhero persona gives a lot of freedom in terms of the expression of the pedestrian alter-ego. For example, while Bruce Wayne is usually depicted as tall and  muscular, there is a variety in his actual build over time. You have Frank Miller and Ben Affleck portrayals where Bruce is very built, and you have Christian Bale and David Mazzucchelli depictions where he has a leaner build. So at what point do we stop recognizing the character as Bruce Wayne?  


A lot of people are saying that you can't change Dick Grayson from white or white passing to more visually representative of a Romani (an Indo-Aryan Ethnicity with Asian roots) heritage. If you take that stance, then why doesn't it apply to other physical traits? The differences in build I listed above. Or let's go further, is hair color an acceptable change? Is hair color a bigger part of identity than build? Often artists depictions of ""dark hair"" characters will range from brown to black. Is Ezra Miller's Flash as objectionable as a darker complexion Dick Grayson. Shouldn't actors dye their hair or wear wigs to better match the source material? Going back to ethnicity, Cass Cain is canonically biracial. I recognize that's different than being 1/4th romani when 100% romani people can also just be white passing. I also recognize that is significantly more nuanced than simple skin tone, but I would say her artistic depictions have a pretty wide range from very asian to very white. 

I think basically the point I'm trying to make is that it's easy to say a character can be depicted any way you want OR a character has to be depicted as they are traditionally within the cannon. At the same time if it is just a matter of wanting better representation, isn't it not more preferable to create brand new characters?",0,"Visual Identity for DC characters (ex.

But regardless this boy deserves more than to be just another Robin. Not to mention the regression back to his old Robin uniform like stoop DC. 

Dick got Nightwing and grew from the shadow of Batman. Jason got Red hood and created his own code. Tim needs the same.

This has 100% been said before but I just needed to rant. 

I say all this but I have no idea what his alias should be. lol"

I wish that they make individual movies of characters in the ""Pattinson-Verse"" (like how the CW is the Arrow-Verse), in a timeline like: 

- The Batman

- Green Arrow: With Stephen Amell coz he deserves more love

- Superman: Red White and Blue Son (for confussion's sake)

- Wonder Woman: The Return of Gal Gadot

- The Batman 2: With Brayn Cranston as Mr. Freeze and Aaron Paul as Mrs. Freeze

- Green Lantern: The Return of Ryan Reynolds from Harold and Kumar

- The Flash: With Grant Gustin coz fuck Ezra Miller

- The Justice League: introduce Cyborg in a Teen Titans movie coz hes more Titan than Leaguer for me

A big Avengers level threat needs build up, and I think putting out movie after movie based on individual characters is a great way to create a universe. I could see them adapting the first season of Arrow into a Green Arrow movie, and Wonder Woman should continue to be played by Gal Gadot coz I love her.

1656999186,RhythmicCacophony,What if all the Robins were a single person who had a huge character arc,"This is just a thought that I had, but I always found it weird that Batman had multiple Robins. Which is to say that multiple different people took on the vigilante persona of Robin. Starting with Dick Grayson who was then replaced by Jason Todd who was then replaced by Tim Drake who was then replaced by Damian Wayne.

While I know the meta reason this happened was to keep the dynamic Robin had with Batman fresh and interesting as well as give room for various Robins to grow out of the role and into their own people, it still just never sat right with me. I almost saw it as Batman essentially ""shopping"" for a new Robin once his old one had moved on. Which just seems wrong. While I know that's a bit of an oversimplification that doesn't do the context of each new Robin recruitment justice, it's still how I feel.

Thus, I was wondering what other people think about the idea of all the various Robins (Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian) being one character. While that might sound a little unclear, here's sort of what I had in mind:

...

This single unified Robin would be the assassin son of Batman and Talia al Ghul and would slowly gain humanity via becoming Robin, a vigilante sidekick to his father. Later deciding in spite of this that the Joker was too evil for any kind of mercy unlike the rest of the rogues and thus attempting to put him down for good, only to fail and get beaten to death. Later being revived by a Lazarus Pit due to being the grandson of Ra's al Ghul. Becoming mentally disturbed and returning to Gotham in order to kill all the criminals including the Joker. Being stopped by his father who would help him move past his trauma. In the aftermath deciding to leave Gotham behind in favor of finding a new purpose in his life due to all he had been through. Eventually teaming up with other young vigilante sidekicks and deciding to create a superhero team with them known as the Titans. As he spent time with them his broken soul would mend back together (figuratively and literally) and he would become a healthy mature young man. Taking on the moniker of Nightwing and becoming a much more upbeat and hopeful superhero instead of a glum and serious one.

...

So as you can see, this hypothetical single unified Robin is basically an amalgamation of all the different Robins put into a single character that goes on what is surprisingly enough a pretty good character arc that fits together rather nicely.

 I remember when Williamson said that Dark Crisis would be a wild ride to the Titans fans, and u know, I thought ""oh, something will happen to them"" but after all it's just because he decided to destroy the Tower, put Slade defeating them , ""killing"" characters, and all of that without them having any lines⁉️, besides Nightwing ofc! He is DC's favorite Batboy lol. DC really hates the Titans because there's no reason to nerf them just to make Deathstroke win a battle when they could just have put Deathstroke going to Bludhaven to kill Nightwing (because Slade literally says he's only interested in Nightwing), I wonder if that was the original plan but the bat editorial didn't let it happen because it would break the Tumblr life of Nightwing in his current run🚶, anyway, Titans are never beating the crisis's punchbag allegations",0,"dark crisis #2 spoilers Not really SPOILERS(but it has some spoilers) , just some my opinions about the issue:

 I remember when Williamson said that Dark Crisis would be a wild ride to the Titans fans, and u know, I thought ""oh, something will happen to them"" but after all it's just because he decided to destroy the Tower, put Slade defeating them , ""killing"" characters, and all of that without them having any lines⁉️, besides Nightwing ofc!

1656928123,Sorrowshowls,How would Batman react to this?,"I'm writing a fanfiction of DC with my character having the grace of Lucifer from Supernatural, 

My MC, let's call him Sam for now,

Sam is a Muslim, he was just praying until he after prayer, blacked out and found himself in a garbage bin, with a energy inside of him he couldn't possibly comprehend.

It whispered to him that it could do so much for him as long as he asked, and well, he did.

He always wanted a white suit and a healthier body which it gave him.

He thought this was a dream, cause he heard about people having lucid dreams though he never experienced one himself.

As he walked through an alley he heard sounds of struggle and saw a man assaulting a woman, 

He saw the injustice and wanted to stop it, the power inside him told him, he just needed to say the word, though as he was about to, a man in a bat suit crashed down from the sky and beat the man up, 

Sam was perplexed, this dream was getting weirder and weirder, was that really Batman?

He walked closer and as he did, he wanted to know who the man was and why he was doing this, 

His power as such brushed against the mind of the criminal and saw that he had committed many crimes such as, murder, theft, r*p*, slave trafficking for the Penguin, and that this was the second time he escaped from prison.

And as he saw all that he was disgusted.

He was quite a religious person and was taught right and wrong from his parents, was taught by them to be forgiving, but not silent in the face of oppression and injustice.

He knew Batman would just throw him back into prison with a couple of broken bones, and was not satisfied with that.

He wanted the man to be punished, and the power whispered again that he only needed to say the word, and so he did.

""Bleed"" he whispered and as he did, the criminal started to bleed from his ears and eyes, he was squaling like a pig, until he exploded.

And the Bat saw all of it...

---------------------

This is of course a rough draft I will go more in detail when I write the real thing, but I am interested in with Batman would do after this?

Would he call the justice league? Talk Sam down, and if if doesn't work go against him?

Would Batman be in the right going against him? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.

Also, so that I don't blaspheme, I'll just say that all these powers aren't real and only God Has the power to do all this.

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

[July 4, 2022 - Does Superman Grill with Charcoal or Propane Edition] Hey there honorary Justice League members - it’s a new week which means it’s time for a new discussion thread!

- Beary's pick of the week: [*Batman* #125](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LIBCTTezL.jpg)

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

**Join the Monthly Book Club! This month's book is Green Lantern: Earth One, Vol. 1 and you can [join the discussion right now here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/vqzb47/july_2022_book_club_green_lantern_earth_one_vol_1/)**

Like are there housing and apartments? Is there a civilization, tows, city, country sides? Like wtf even goes down on Apokolips?? 

If Darkseid has all these slaves in his control, wtf do they even do if they're is nothing going on?? Like are they mining mineral's? Are they his house cleaners or are they building stuff?? But from what I see they're are no buildings!!! 

It's confusing because Darkseid makes himself out to be this super powerful guy who should be feared but it looks like his planet hasn't evolved past the stone age. It's so plain, so bare bones!!! At least New Genesis is thriving. They evolved so well!! They got beautiful cloud city's and a safe civilization for all, they are thousands of years ahead in technology and clearly give a shit about keeping there planet in good condition. New Genesis actually gives a shit!!

It seems to me like Darkseid is just a lazy, unmotivated, jealous fedora tippin' man who's having a rage fit all the time. I mean no wonder he's always at war with New Genesis or Earth, he's probably jealous af!! These planets have achieved what Darkseid could never as a ruler. 

I mean please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, I'd love to know if Apokolips is actually a thriving planet growing and evolving, I'd love to hear some Apokolips history and lore. To me it just seems like a bunch of nothingness, so maybe they just never show it??

1656860120,Available_Range1851,Potential Headcanon: Jason was considered the most brutal/violent Robin because he matched Batman's brutality. Dick as the OG Robin was obviously kicking ass but was not as brutal as Batman was at such a young age.,"I'm sure this has been said over and over again before. But it has honestly bothered me that Jason was considered reckless and violent when he was just following his mentor. Again this is not a new concept and probably has been said before. 

Now the thing about Dick being less violent may or may not be true, I have not done that much research into how violent Dick was as Robin. There are probably panels that show they may have been the same level of brutality and the writers just really hated Jason. 

But in my mind the reason Jason was considered more reckless/dangerous was because his violence was on par with Batman. And honestly he probably had the recklessness of any other kid.

1656858375,DeathLight7000,How DC has treated Tim over the years is shameful,"So after eleven years Tim Drake is finally getting an ongoing series but even as a longtime Tim Drake fan I am just not excited at all and that is mainly because of how DC has handled and treated Tim over the past decade. 

He was one of the best characters in the Batfamily post crisis in my opinion the reasons why he was so great was because of his growth as a character going from Robin to Red Robin.

 However ever since the New 52 he's has struggled to stay relevant he got put into a Teen titans book that nobody read or liked, his origin got retconned everything that was great about the character felt like it was stripped away (I assume this was all Dan Didio's handiwork).

In Rebirth in James Tynion's run on detective a lot of what he lost in the New 52 got restored somewhat like his origin, his relationship with Steph but during James Tynion's run he was also ""killed"" off and was therefore sidelined for awhile when you wanted to see mire of him. 

After that he started appearing in Young Justice in which Bendis started hyping up his new identity which I was also pretty excited for fans came up with so many names but the result was so disappointing. 

Then after that series got cancelled he just stayed in limbo for awhile making sporadic appearances here and there this is something that has happened with him a lot ever since his solo got cancelled in New 52 and it's so frustrating for a fan to see his favorite character just disappear from comics altogether.

Then we got the Urban legends story which was controversial some of people liked it some people hated it I personally didn't have a problem with it(the only problem I have with it was how they ended his relationship with Steph) if it actually meant he would get more spotlight and attention from DC but after that story came out there was a lot of months of just absolutely nothing, he fell into a limbo again.

Finally the solo series was eventually announced and the choice of the writer really doesn't make me wanna read it. The recently released Young justice issue was quite bad with many characters written out of character and the pride special wasn't great either.
 
I really want the series to be good but I just don't think it's going to be I hope that his relationship with Barnard doesn't take priority over him being a superhero because at the end of the day it's a series about a superhero and him being a superhero should take priority above all else.",0,"How DC has treated Tim over the years is shameful So after eleven years Tim Drake is finally getting an ongoing series but even as a longtime Tim Drake fan I am just not excited at all and that is mainly because of how DC has handled and treated Tim over the past decade.

1656786249,Available_Range1851,Can someone please explain the full extent of the Homo Magi?,"I've been doing a lot of research about the magic world within DC Universe. So far I understand that the Homo Magi are a hidden community and that Zatanna's mother was a Homo Magi. 

Like I know that John Constantine isn't a Homo Magi but he is someone who has more magical abilities than the average person. But generally Zatanna is known to have a natural affinity to magic because she is Homo Magi. And there are people who are descended from Fae like Tim Hunter who have the ability to use magic. There are people like Raven who are half human, half demon but because of her demon she has access to magic as well. 

Also if Homo Magi are just a certain evolution of humans does that mean there are other Homo Magi's around the world? Does that mean a kid could just be born as Homo Magi?

Sorry If this post got away from me a bit.",0,"Can someone please explain the full extent of the Homo Magi? I've been doing a lot of research about the magic world within DC Universe. So far I understand that the Homo Magi are a hidden community and that Zatanna's mother was a Homo Magi. 

Like I know that John Constantine isn't a Homo Magi but he is someone who has more magical abilities than the average person. But generally Zatanna is known to have a natural affinity to magic because she is Homo Magi. And there are people who are descended from Fae like Tim Hunter who have the ability to use magic. There are people like Raven who are half human, half demon but because of her demon she has access to magic as well. 

Also if Homo Magi are just a certain evolution of humans does that mean there are other Homo Magi's around the world? Does that mean a kid could just be born as Homo Magi?

1656753080,Internetz-Sailor,Wonder Woman vs Dr. Psycho Comics.,"Since watching the ""Harley Quinn"" animated series, I've gotten interested into the supervillain known as Dr. Psycho. I'm not a DC comics reader, most of my knowledge is thanks to the animated series (please don't hate me), and it's through Harley Quinn that I first learned of Wonder Woman's arch nemesis.

Dr.Psycho was unlike any supervillain I've ever seen in a super hero show. A  small person psychic that is a psychologist and a misogynist and enjoys to inflict cruelty on others. And I've been wanting to know more about him. I've searched for him on Wikipedia, fan wiki, YouTube, and such. Unfortunately there isn't much info, and he remains largely obscured within mainstream. But even if there is info of him, I want to enjoy him through comics since that is the best way.

So I ask you, fans: what are some good comics that have Dr. Psycho as the main antagonist? I mainly want to read stories that are about Wonder Woman vs Dr. Psycho exclusively. Or comics that explore his origin. Or villain focused comics.

And to clarify, I'm looking for the second version of Dr. Psycho. The one that is only a telepath/psychic, the version on which the Harley Quinn version is based of. I'm also fine with old and modern Wonder Woman comics. As I've said before, I want the focus of the comic to be Wonder Woman vs Dr. Psycho. It's also fine if it's Giganta and Dr. Psycho vs Wonder Woman-since they seem to be a villain duo on occasion.

Thanks, and much appreciation for your help.",0,"Wonder Woman vs Dr. Psycho Comics.

* He'd love to tackle Ted Kord Blue Beetle
* He wants to play in the ""unused"" section of the DCU
* Wants to explore the DC universe, is cramming as much stuff as possible 
* ""It's very strange people love my work and it's very exciting"" 
* Big event in the Flash book next year 
* I asked ""did you mean Flash book as in singular or Flash books as in plural""? Only one Flash book for now, but he will literally take on any book DC gives him
* Really appreciates the kind words/comments people leave on Twitter.
* Original way Tim Sheridan (who Adams is very good friends with)  and Adams had a FP idea and their editor said ""lets talk to Geoff"". They went into a room, and broke things up like a TV show. Adams is a big fan of Geoff's work, and is learning a lot from him.
* His FortNite crew is texting him during this Spaces 
* Jeremy Adams' dad drew a Captain Atom run, including one that Greg Weisman worked on.
* Second Mortal Kombat movie he worked on had 40 minutes cut due to time. - He did a lego Flash movie, he had an idea where the Justice League turned the Hall of Justice into the Mall of Justice (Superman cooking hot dogs, Batman making vitamin smothies) but he couldn't fit it in due to lack of time in the film
* The Legion of Doom issue was a dream come true because he loves Kevin M. and the JLI. He thought DC was pranking him when they suggested it. He will pay for the original art for that issue, if Kevin M. is listening 
* HE'S HAD LUNCH WITH MARK WAID A FEW TIMES. Adams is trying to live up to Waid's Flash run. 
* He feels ""the weight"" of Wally's fans embracing his run. 
* It was Adams idea to do the Quantum Leap arc. The HiC moment was one of ""closure"" for him, the fans, and the character. 
* He has a Flash event planned that will involve all Flash characters, including Max and Jesse",0,"Jeremy Adams Twitter Spaces Highlights! Jeremy Adams was hosting a Twitter Spaces Q&amp;A, I have some of the highlights here.

1656724652,NoctSora,[Discussion] So the Tim Drake Special made Tim look bad and did Steph dirty,"My biggest issue with the Tim Drake Pride Special is how both Tim and Steph were written.

Tim came across a massive jerk as he dumped Steph without a reason, and then ghosted her for months and quickly entered a new relationship from the get go  and he was actively avoiding her and it was only by chance he came across her again. He also had the nerve to ask Steph if she was mad at him. Not to mention during their talk he said she has always been everything he ever wanted and more? If that is the case then why dump and ghost her? It makes him look flaky and non-commited to their relationship as while he did dump her before realizing he was bi, the story indicates that due to his questioning sexuality did he dump her which overlaps with this.

There was also the fact that introducing your partner who you had a very intense relationship with after dumping them for no reason, ghosting them and reconnecting by accident to your new partner without telling them is a very inconsiderate and selfish thing to do. He should have asked Steph first if she wanted to meet him. It's like he was expecting them to be friends without even asking if that was what Steph wanted. In the past Tim was hesitant to introduce Steph to his new girlfriends as he knew it would be awkward and have some tension, so this is OOC for him as well.

Steph was treated badly as well. She instantly forgives Tim and then upon meeting Bernard fangirls over him and says it is ""the best day ever"". Aside from the fact NO ONE would act like that upon being treated like she was, it made her look like a prop just to shill Bernard and reassure twitter/tumblr that she isn't a threat to Bernard. She has also NEVER acted like this when meeting Tim's other partners. She acted polite, awkward or showed jealously but subdued. Not allowing her to have complex feelings on the most important romantic relationship of her history/life denies her agency and is a huge disservice to her.",0,"[Discussion] So the Tim Drake Special made Tim look bad and did Steph dirty My biggest issue with the Tim Drake Pride Special is how both Tim and Steph were written.

1656683207,trover2345325,[Other] What happens if Warner Bros have their own Book division and reduce DC as a brand label for their book division,"You know, Warner Bros own DC comics right? 

Well, what  if Warner Bros is going to make their own book division that will publish comic books and novels both original and based on licensed properties, then DC  the comic book company Warner Bros owned will no longer be a company but will be reduced as Brand labels and be part of WB's publishing division. 

And if  DC comics is reduced as brand labels for WB's publishing division, then that means  DC will only publish DC superhero stories and will no longer  publish licensed properties like  Looney tunes  and Scooby-Doo  comic book stories including adaptation of Warner bros shows which is now handled by Warner Bros own book division as DC will only publish their superhero properties like Superman,batman,Wonder Woman and more. 

But off-note, if  Warner Bros  make their own book division and turn DC  into a brand and is  part of their book division .Maybe, I think a hard reboot is needed for the DC universe, think about it whenever a comic book writer and artist becomes showrunner they will be in charge and give their reimagined take of  the DC universe and the characters with a beginning to end for few years , while the classics will live on as standalone stories .",0,"[Other] What happens if Warner Bros have their own Book division and reduce DC as a brand label for their book division You know, Warner Bros own DC comics right?

Where would a new fan start? It seems a daunting task, getting in this late, and part of me is embarrassed to even be here asking. But I want to get more involved and entrenched in the universe as a whole so on top of my main question, “where should I start?” here are a few other side questions:

Is it even worth starting anything pre new 52? I’m aware of events up to crisis on infinite earths but that’s about it, and again only on a very surface level. 

Does the dc animated universe, specifically the films, cover enough of the source material to skip around? Or should I go back and read the source material for those films? 

Is there anything that is not worth my time? A silly question I know but honestly if there’s anything not worth the read I’d rather know now so I don’t waste my time on it. I’m not necessarily speaking about storylines or arcs that aren’t canon, if it’s good it’s good, more so poor writing, unnecessary or convoluted series, irrelevant or boring stuff, etc.

But I've never been into all the really tropey good guy vs bad guy super hero action. It just isn't deep enough for me. I love a well developed story and/or world; and a great character is a necessity. I prefer somebody who isn't omnipotent or has obvious plot armor.. Somebody who struggles as we all do. And I prefer the threats around them to be well developed as well, I can get around the threats if the protagonist(s) are well developed; but somebody who has fallen into evil for a very relatable human desire I often find most compelling.

For example; The reason I like Batman a lot is everything around him is well developed. We have the entirety of Gotham City with all its nooks and crannies full of malicious intent waiting to be uncovered. Many of the villains fell into their personas due to their own falls from grace, mental illness, or greed. And Batman himself is only a human with fancy gadgets, as well as a traumatized child and a victim to the worst kind of robbery - life.

So for those of you who enjoy a well developed narrative similarly, what have you enjoyed ? My mind is fresh within DC, as well as comics in general.

1656513732,Neither_Prize_8386,My redesign of the Star Saphire's Emblem and Emotional Entity,"So in my previous post, I mentioned how I was trying to redesign the star sapphire's because of how dumb the emotional entity is and also how out of place the symbol is. So eventually I came to the conclusion of making the new version a plant. My reason is, A, it's the only life form not used in the other designs of the emotional entities, and B, still works when implamenting both the caring side and parasitic side of love. So anyway below is the redesign of the symbol, it represents the emotional entity of The Caretaker, a large planet-spanning plant being. Just like the original Star Sapphires (btw there just called the violet lanterns now for obvious reasons) it recruits members with a great deal of love and makes them become obsessive with that love and imprison that thing to maintain it. However there are a few key differences, first, they imprison the things they love in sap not crystals, second, it's no longer just romantic love it can be any love as long as it can be sealed (like it can't be love for violence unless I can work that in somehow) even entire nations! Because of the third reason, once the item or person is sealed in the sap it's taken back to the homeworld where the Caretaker resides and placed in its forest to be kept intact as long as the lantern helps in also maintaining the Caretaker's forest. Also, no more men aren't included in the corps bs, men aren't exclusive to rage and violence and women aren't exclusive to love. Anyway, that's my redesign of the Violet Lantern corps please let me know what you think and if I should change anything. P.s. if you say to change the color, I will inform you it is violet according to the colors on the program I made it with.

1656511468,Some-Dog9800,"I know it's been done to death, but here's my concept for how the DCEU should have gone (includes Phase 1)"," **PHASE 1: Return of Heroes**

* **The Flash vs The Rogues -** Barry Allen searches around the world for a hidden nuclear bomb using his superspeed as he’s ambushed by several of his Rogues hired to delay his search. It’s eventually revealed that the bomb is not actually a nuclear bomb, but a gene-bomb, brought from the future by the film’s main villain, Professor Zoom. The gene-bomb interacts with a metahuman’s metagene and activates it. Flash finds it but is unable to stop it from going off as Zoom pulls him into the speed force for a final confrontation. This triggers a Metahuman Outbreak throughout Markovia.
* **The Manhunter From Mars -** While working as a private detective under the name “John Jones”, the Martian Manhunter is confronted by his brother, martian scientist Ma’alefa’ak. Meanwhile, a shadow organization known as Helix led by the mysterious Mister Bones intent on documenting and counteracting alien presence on Earth targets both Ma’alefa’ak and the Martian Manhunter. Bones’ metagene was activated while he was still in the womb, causing his mother to die instantly upon his birth from the cyanide compound constantly exuding from his skin. Ma’alefa’ak kills Mister Bones in the climax. By the end of the film, Helix has evolved into the DEO, now affiliated with the government, still somehow led by Mr. Bones despite his prior death.
* **Wonder Woman: Battle of the Seven Seas -** .With Atlantis and Themyscira on the brink of war, Wonder Woman allies with Aquaman to uncover a conspiracy. The main villains are Queen Clea and Myrina. Clea is the despotic ruler of Venturia, a remote kingdom in the Atlantean continent. She plans to use growing conflicts in order to weaken the other Atlantean kingdoms and eventually take control of the entire continent. She uses Myrina, a former Amazon who left the island prior to Diana’s birth to work as an assassin on Man’s Isles\* to fuel the conflict. Myrina is killed in battle by the Amazon Phillipus during the climax. Orm is the king at this point, and is killed by Vulko in the climax. Ocean Master is portrayed as misguided rather than downright evil.
* **The Adventures of Superman -** As he moves to Metropolis and begins working at the Daily Planet, Clark Kent encounters a series of villains in his first year as Superman. First, Superman battles a Neo-Nazi terrorist known as Atoman targeting jewish-owned businesses using Intergang weaponry, who was inspired by Superman to don a colorful persona for his activities, believing him to be the first of the “Aryan ubermensch” that the Nazi Regime spoke of. Secondly, he and Lois investigate the weapons distribution ring, Intergang and expose Moxie Mannheim as their leader. Finally, a LexCorp scientist named Joseph Martin has his metagene activated and becomes the Atomic Skull following an “accident” orchestrated by Lex Luthor so he could lure out Superman, fascinated by and envious of the Man of Steel. Superman battles the Atomic Skull in the heart of Metropolis. This film is an anthology containing three separate stories connected by plot threads such as Intergang and Superman’s growing influence over the people of Metropolis, which culminates into a climax in which the people of Metropolis help Superman in his battle against Atomic Skull.
* **Batman: Phosphorus -** In this film, Batman faces Dr. Alexander Sartorius, better known as Dr. Phosphorus, whose metagene was activated following an accident in a nuclear power plant. Phosphorus blackmails the Gotham City Council by threatening to expose the council’s covering up the accident that made him in order to establish himself as a key figure in Gotham organized crime. Phosphorus also kidnaps his former lab partner, Kirk Langstrom, seeking to use his research into the Man-Bat formula to enhance his understanding of the metagene. Introduced are several key Gotham mafia players such as Alberto Falcone, Killer Croc and Baby Doll, Nocturna, El Flamingo, Ventriloquist, Hush, and the Great White Shark. The Bat-Family is hinted at in this film and explored in more detail later in the saga.
* **Green Arrow and the Black Canary -** Shortly after returning to Star City from years on an island, Green Arrow targets the China White Triad alongside Black Canary. Mainly serves to introduce Green Arrow and his world.
* **Justice League: Dominion -** The first Justice League movie features the Dominators ( as main villains. Initially, they target Earth as they fear the rise of metahumans on the planet. They experiment on members of the human race with the metagene in order to enhance members of their species as well as understand its nature, and discover that it is activated under intense pressure. This is done from the nation of Markovia, the epicenter of metahuman activity since the metahuman outbreak in “The Flash”, and enabled by Markovia’s leaders. Eventually, they learn how to impact metahumans using weapons that target the gene. The film features the formation of the League to stop the Dominators. Lex Luthor assists the Justice League, interested in the Dominators’ research into the metagene. At the end of the film, Lex begins a program to house metahumans experimented on by the Dominators and help develop their powers in order to further his own nefarious ends.

I don't mean that there shouldn't be a Robin. But in the case of Dick, Jason and Tim, they should be training and assisting from the cave until they become legal. Batman: The Animated Series handled Dick very well, but Tim not so much. Keep in mind that the original reason for Robin was to have a Watson. Well, Alfred became a more logical choice, but thanks to online communication, now underaged Robins can do it from the cave. 

As for the Titans, it's just the same, underaged Robins can command from the computer. Some Titans are powerhouses on a JLA level, but Roy, Garth, Gar and Vic can be killed by a thug with a gun. 

Archer are at the bottom of the food chain. It makes sense for Robin Hood but now it's like trying to block the impact of a train with an umbrella. Green bullet makes sense, green arrow... Not so much.

Other teenagers that make sense are independent acts, like Static or Blue Beetle III (or Spider-man). They are doing it on their own and they have the chops. 

The common reply to this is that it is fiction, and yes, it doesn't need to be realistic, but it does need to have verisimilitude.

Given all of this, I feel like I’ve never heard of a modern rewrite for Death in the family. The story is incredibly iconic, but I feel like not many people know what happened after Jason actually died. Back then, Robin’s death was followed by a Joker plot with him posing as the UN’s Ambassador of Iran. 

With how often we get different flavors of classic origin stories, I’d love to see a deep dive on Jason covering Bruce’s life immediately after his death and a more realistic confrontation with Joker considering he literally murderer his son.",0,"Is there a proper modern retelling of Jason Todd’s death?

Given all of this, I feel like I’ve never heard of a modern rewrite for Death in the family. The story is incredibly iconic, but I feel like not many people know what happened after Jason actually died. Back then, Robin’s death was followed by a Joker plot with him posing as the UN’s Ambassador of Iran. 

With how often we get different flavors of classic origin stories, I’d love to see a deep dive on Jason covering Bruce’s life immediately after his death and a more realistic confrontation with Joker considering he literally murderer his son."

The Batman AMC early screening nft, ALL #s were just different angles, OF ONLY THE BAT MOBILE.

They ALL look the same, except sometimes the ears are longer to look like horns or the mouth is a different shape. Other than that, it's just all multi colored. 

Someone has been trying to sell that all yellow cowl for 5k down to 1k now, and it just looks like a goblin.

1656189395,Superboy_Fan,"[Discussion]What does everyone think of DC's branding, The New Age of DC Heroes from 2018","So if you don't don't know, in 2018 DC started a new branding known as the The New Age of DC Heroes , which was meant to tie into Dark Knights: Metal. Dan Didio who was the then publisher of DC at the time and he was overseeing this initiative that was meant to bring all sorts of original heroes into the DCU instead of Legacy heroes( Which Didio hated).

These Titles included

Damage, The Silencer, Sideways, The Terrifics, The Curse of Brimstone, The Immortal Men, New Challengers, and The Unexpected

This intiative which ran from 2018 to 2020 was considered a financial failure, and none of the  new heroes they were trying to set up were never seen again

they have some preexisting heroes and concepts used in this such as the Terrifics which was composed of Metamorpho, Phantom Girl, Plastic man and Mister Terrific, this unsuprisingly was the longest running comic of this branding because it used well known characters. the other comics with used an already familiar concept was the new Challengers which was a new team of the Challengers of the Unknown.

Who knows maybe if Dan Didio's DCU had come into fruition where all the DC heroes aged realistically maybe these heroes would have had a future in that if Dan hadn't been fired and this world would have been made. some of the heroes have showed up in other comics, such as Sideways showing up in Bendis's Young Justice run, so maybe these characters can show up at some point but they have not showed up in the last 2 years.

What do you guys think of this branding and do you guys think some of these characters have potential? let me know:)",0,"[Discussion]What does everyone think of DC's branding, The New Age of DC Heroes from 2018 So if you don't don't know, in 2018 DC started a new branding known as the The New Age of DC Heroes , which was meant to tie into Dark Knights: Metal.

1656076402,Macapta,So why do Yellow Lantern rings choose their users like that?,"Other rings choose their users based on how strongly they feel and can channel the attributed emotion. Hal has a lot of Will so he gets a green. Lard lees is greedy as hell so he gets the orange. Atrocitus is as angry as someone can get so he gets a red etc. 

But yellows are chosen for their ability to instil fear in others, not because they feel immense fear themselves. I jus find it odd since if the user is not producing the emotion, then what is powering and channeling the ring to make its constructs? If the ring pulled from the fear of those around it, then it would never be able to be proactive and unable to create fear, since fear is first required to use the ring. 

I get that it would be hard to have a villainous faction that can barely fight due to being too terrified of everything, but I still think it would work to have the users be very fearful people.

**Superman #8**

**Story 4**

There is an epidemic of crime in Metropolis, and they are all dope addicts!  Shootings in the street almost kill both Lois and some children  The dealer, however, has a good lawyer that always gets them off.  Superman lures them into a trap by catching them red-handed trying to steal morphine.  The slimy lawyer gets them off.  Clark then attends a party at one of their houses and catches them murdering an accomplice.  They attempt to burn the body, but Superman grabs them, stuffs them in a van, crushing the door, and then calls the cops.  All are arrested.

This is a really short description, mostly because the comic itself is very generic.  It barely interests me, considering the sheer insanity of all the ones that came before it.  Superman throwing them in a deliver van and then crushing the end of it so they can't escape was kind of cool, but other than that there's just a lot of talking and not a lot of action.  Not all comics are going to be winners I suppose.

**Action Comics #32, Cover Date: January 1941**

Clark gets a call about a man threatening to jump off a bridge.   He charges there as Superman and saves him, only for the man to tell him that he gambled away all his money at the Preston Club.  Superman then TREATENS THE MAN's LIFE NOT TO COMMITT SUICIDE (because that's how it works???) and decides to investigate the Preston Club as Clark.  He goes with the mayor to said club, but it appears to be just a gentleman's club (in the traditional sense, not the modern one you pervs).  Afterwards, however, Clark overhears that the Mayor is being blackmailed.  Lois decides to go on her own...and promptly gets discovered and drugged.  Preston sends men to kill Clark, but Superman beats them down and heads to the club, finding Lois wandering outside, in a daze.  It turns out, she took a drug to make her lose all her memories.  Although doctors can do nothing, Clark uses his hypnotic vision to bring her out of it (uh...I mean...okay?).  Clark then builds a ""Krypto-Raygun,"" which is basically something that can take pictures and then shine them on a wall like a projector.  Superman gets the pictures of the gambling, busts down the door and beats everyone up.  Preston runs to the mayor's office, where Lois is already.  It turns out, Preston gave the memory-wiping drug to the mayor's son and says he won't cure him if the mayor arrests him.  The mayor, however, has had enough and refuses to help Preston.  Preston then kidnaps them both.  Meanwhile, Superman uses his hypnosis powers to cure the mayor's son.  Superman then chases them down, saves the car from running off and cliff, and brings Preston to the police.  The mayor is worried that he'll be ruined, but Clark says he'll be just fine, since he'll testify that the mayor is being blackmailed...which apparently excuses everything he did!

Oh boy!  Back to insanity!  Okay, I don't know where Superman learned to save suicidal people, but apparently they didn't teach him logic.  Threatening a suicidal man with death is...not gonna work???  They're already suicidal??  Like...huh???  Then the mayor is involved with a racketeering scandal and also helped cover it up.  I don't think the whole ""yeah but my son!"" is really going to help him here.  If something like that happens, you're supposed to call the police.  If someone kidnapped your son and forced you to commit crimes you're still on the hook for those crimes.  Plus, the mayor is also REALLY STUPID.  Like, what motivation does the crook have to cure your son?  He's just going to string you along forever.  Finally, and apparently, Superman can build sci-fi nonsense devices and has the abilities to counter-act drugs that destroy people's brains.  Good powers to have, I guess!

**Action Comics #33, Cover Date: February 1941**

A lumber magnate changes his will to turn a lumber forest into a summer camp for boys after he dies...and then he promptly and mysteriously dies.  The brother of said magnate contests the will saying that his brother was insane at the time of writing the will, but he loses the case.  Several months later, the revenue from the company has dried up because of sabotage that has killed the workers.  Lois and Clark decide to head out to the forest to pretend to look for jobs.  When they arrive on the site the evil overseer (who DOES NOT look like the man from those Brawny paper towel commercials, I assure you) says he'll put them to work.  Later, however, the Brawny man tells the boatman working for the company to dump Lois overboard.  The boatman does so, and Lois is swept out into a whirlpool in the lake (IN VIVID COLOR that are um...totally not the colors of a lake?)  Clark, however, senses that something is wrong.  He flies over as Superman and rescues her (IN VIVID COLOR AGAIN).  Lois comes to, but the Brawny man locks them both in a cabin.  Clark uses hypnosis to stun Lois and leaps from the cabin with them both.  He then turns into Superman and springs to action and follows the Brawny man back to the head office.  Naturally at this point Lois comes to and tries to sneak in, only to get kidnapped as she usually does.  The guy in the head office wearing a mask, however, pulls out a gun and kills both the Brawny man and the boatman.  Superman then barges in.  A piece of wood, flying through the air, catches one of the bullets and ricochets back into the masked mans head (THAT'S NOT HOW BULLETS WORK!)  To the surprise of no one, it is revealed that it is the brother of the magnate, who also killed his brother and tried to sabotage the company so he could buy it up for cheap.

You know, normally I don't talk about the artwork.  It's mostly because it's all uniform and the same.  I mean, so far it's been drawn by the same people over and over again.  This time, however, I just have to mention that they way they drew the lake was objectively GORGEOUS.  Like when Lois and Superman were under the water, there were these intricate patterns of colors swirling around them.  Lois was also striking some dramatic poses with her clothes and hair floating around her.  It looked like a renaissance painting, something that should be hung in a museum.  I'm not a guy who really likes are or anything, but definitely check this one out and see what I mean.  That being said THAT'S NOT WHAT WATER LOOKS LIKE.  You don't go underwater and see a flippin' rainbow of colors, like a giant who ate a bag of skittle threw up in it.  Also, I KNOW THIS IS A COMIC BOOK and it has a loose interpretation of physics but if you SHOOT WOOD THE BULLET WILL NOT BOUNCE BACK.  Like what kind of wood are they chopping down at this lumberyard?  We should be making tanks out of that and not steel.  I'm not even sure why they bothered even giving the brother a mask, as anyone over the age of three with a grasp on object permanence could tell it was him.  Whatever, I'm not DC Comics.

Like when Lois and Superman were under the water, there were these intricate patterns of colors swirling around them.  Lois was also striking some dramatic poses with her clothes and hair floating around her.  It looked like a renaissance painting, something that should be hung in a museum.  I'm not a guy who really likes are or anything, but definitely check this one out and see what I mean.  That being said THAT'S NOT WHAT WATER LOOKS LIKE.  You don't go underwater and see a flippin' rainbow of colors, like a giant who ate a bag of skittle threw up in it.  Also, I KNOW THIS IS A COMIC BOOK and it has a loose interpretation of physics but if you SHOOT WOOD THE BULLET WILL NOT BOUNCE BACK.  Like what kind of wood are they chopping down at this lumberyard?  We should be making tanks out of that and not steel.  I'm not even sure why they bothered even giving the brother a mask, as anyone over the age of three with a grasp on object permanence could tell it was him.  Whatever, I'm not DC Comics.  What do I know?"

1655961331,ErictheRed117,This Month Marks the Seventh Year I've Been Collecting DC Comics,"Seven years ago this month, I went to one of the comic shops in my town for the first time. I was 13 years old and had been thoroughly amazed by the comics I had been reading in the graphic novel section of the library (mostly Batman) for the past year.

There was something about comics that I had never experienced in any entertainment medium before. The covers were always flashy and promising, but the stories inside could be anything from brightly colored slugfests to moving stories about larger than life characters. I loved all of it and  wanted more. So I looked for any nearby comic shops on the internet, chose the smaller less ostentatious of the two in my town, and asked my mom to drive me over to have a look.

When I walked in, there was a a whole rack of new comics that stretched about half the length of the store, plus boxes and boxes of back issues from almost every era in comics history. There were graphic novels too, and paperback collections of series I had only read about online. There were collectors edition issues, as well as some particularly valuable issues that were way out of my price range at the time (and many still are).

Beyond that, there were plenty of other ""nerdy"" delights scattered throughout the shop; trading card games, tabletop RPGs, badass collectible figurines, and pretty much anything else one could ever want. (Later, I would briefly get into, and regularly play, Magic: The Gathering at the shop.)

The then mid-60 year old man who runs the place knew pretty much everything you could think of about all of it. Though a bit difficult to deal with at first, he helped me understand the basics of the DC universe and where I should start if I was truly interested in getting into comics. This is right after Convergence and the end of the New 52, so to say I was a little lost was an understatement. Regardless, I purchased my first new comic there, Detective Comics #41, the first issue of the second series to not be a part of the New 52.

Looking back, the storyline of that and the next few issues is god-awful (Jim Gordon replaces Bruce as the police-sanctioned Batman for a time), but at the time I didn't care. I was so excited to finally be part of something I had tentatively enjoyed for a while. Now I had the chance to throw myself into this medium and subculture for real.

And I definitely did. 7 years later, I'm 20, working towards a college degree, and generally being an adult, but I still love and respect comics. I still go to that same shop every week (and the other store in town if I have extra money) to pick up my pull list. I started reading Marvel comics too, some years back, but that's a story for a different time and subreddit.

I've definitely changed in the last 7 years and I actually partially credit comics for the good and the difficult during that time.

In the last 4 years my worldview and understanding of life have changed drastically. I was born into a very conservative Christian family. I was rarely exposed to other beliefs or ways of life, but I often got glimpses of the outside world through movies and video games. Comics, however, had arguably the biggest impact in my life. There I was exposed characters of different religions, races, sexual orientations, political views, etc.

I remember reading Batwoman: Elegy years ago. It was one of my first non-hostile introductions to the idea that same-sex relationships can be enjoyable. I remember reading Black Lightning: Year One and realizing that I, a white person, could enjoy comics starring racially diverse characters without feeling like I was being ""replaced."" So yeah. Anyone who says comics shouldn't be diverse is, well, just wrong. It can have a positive effect on readers (like me).

Similarly, during high school, my mental state fell to pieces. I had no real support from friends or family and therapy or medicine was hard to come by. But I still had comics. I got to read stories of imperfect heroes, who often had fragile mental and emotional lives, but were still able to do superhuman tasks for the benefit of others. It gave me hope and a sense of self that I desperately needed.

The idea of turning to a favored entertainment medium for support during rough times is often seen as a cliche, or worse, labeled as escapism. But for those really suffering, having something to enjoy with no strings attached; just good stories and iconic characters; can literally be a saving grace.

I won't be overly dramatic and claim that comics changed my life, but they have been a constant source of enjoyment, imagination, and progress for almost a decade now. I've changed and so have comics, but my enjoyment of them has remained constant. I love them now as much, if not more, than I did in seventh grade, when I got the first comic I could call my own. And I try to share that love with other people when I can. I have a friend who sometimes accompanies me on my comic trips and listens to my moaning about the Bat/Cat wedding that never was (seriously, fuck Tom King for that). I also bring up comics whenever I see someone wearing a piece of clothing with one of my favorite characters. You never know when somebody wearing a Batman logo can end up talking about classic comics for 10+ minutes with you (it's happened...more than once).

All of this to say, though I may bitch about DC's refusal to change their sacred status quo or allow Batman to be happy (I will never get over that wedding), I love comics. I love the characters, the stories, the themes, and everything else they bring to the table.

I get that Batman is stuck in an ouroborus of lonliness and struggle against evil, but I don't understand why he cannot be happy doing it? It's much like Sisyphus from Albert Camus' Myth of Sisyphus. Sisyphus is trapped in a cycle, not unlike batman, yet Camus encourages his audience to imagine Sisyphus happy, and if I've learned anything from GMs work, it's that imagination is more important than reality. Batman may be alone at the end of the story, but he won't be alone forever. I believe he can grow with his peers, maybe he will grow, he still has Dick, Gordon and Alfred (even though he sends him on vacay). I believe the end of Morrison's run shows that even though evil will always exist, so will the idea of us, our myths. We can create meaning in the cycle of struggle and meaninglessness.

The DCAMU version of dick Grayson is probably the most accurate portrayal of him we’ve seen, over the other four main ones (BTAS, Teen Titans 2003, Young Justice, Titans). I think his arc and characterization are near perfect. His quippy wisecracks, his older brother vibes, closeness to Bruce but desire to be out of Batman’s shadow, and his mentor relationship to damian.

1655829783,Crafty-Bunch-2675,Why does the DCEU have so much trouble lifting off,"Whilst I understand that the DCEU got its start much later than the MCU, I cannot understand why it keeps stumbling so badly like for example:

(1) their inability to make sequels on time
(2) their inability to maintain the same cast
(3) their inability to decide on an overaching story and sticking to it.

An overall lack of direction.

The DCEU has more trailers than movie content.

We have a FLASH movie that we have been seeing trailer of for years now... in fact I have seen so many Flash trailers I'm just not interested. 

Somehow they couldn't keep on Henry Cavill as Superman, nor Ben Affleck as Batman. 

Why did they take so long to follow up with the justice league sequels ?

Some of these projects have been so delayed that even if they were to make a sequel now, the original cast have probably aged out.

End of rant.",0,"Why does the DCEU have so much trouble lifting off Whilst I understand that the DCEU got its start much later than the MCU, I cannot understand why it keeps stumbling so badly like for example:

(1) their inability to make sequels on time
(2) their inability to maintain the same cast
(3) their inability to decide on an overaching story and sticking to it.

An overall lack of direction.

The DCEU has more trailers than movie content.

We have a FLASH movie that we have been seeing trailer of for years now... in fact I have seen so many Flash trailers I'm just not interested. 

Somehow they couldn't keep on Henry Cavill as Superman, nor Ben Affleck as Batman. 

Why did they take so long to follow up with the justice league sequels ?

Some of these projects have been so delayed that even if they were to make a sequel now, the original cast have probably aged out.

1655734390,sammyjamez,"Would it make sense to say that Superman has been reduced to a simple hero with godly abilities and not focused on the ideals that he represents, while Batman is continuously glorified as a perfect being in every way without focusing on his flawed humanity?","The DC heroes are most well-known for their iconography and what they are meant to represent.

The Superman icon, the original hero, is a representation of a person who has so many abilities, almost like that of a god (sometimes when more powerful than what he usually is in the main DC storyline like Superman Prime) but chose to reduce himself to our level, we humans, because he believes that he does is the right thing.

There are obvious similarities here with Christianity and American idealism.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the end, the iconography of Superman is the representation of genuine and just protection from any harm. In short, he is truly meant to be an icon of hope, justice and the American way even if he is a classic hero.

However, I feel that the iconography of Superman has been changed into just simply portraying him as perfect but he is never focused on what he represents even if he is considered as boring because in the end, he is meant to give a feeling of hope that everyone he encounters, no matter how hard their day was or what the person was going through.

We tend to see Superman being portrayed in a manner where we are provoked to question his principles and actions as someone with all that power, a God amongst us humans, may be provoked to think otherwise that he would deem as just - such as in The Dark Knight Returns storyline, in the Red Sun comic and in the Injustice arc.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, Batman is almost an anti-hero version of Superman where his idea of justice is more blurry as he can sometimes jump between vengeance and justice, or between going by the book or vigilantism or a necessary evil.

However, it seems that Batman, being the most popular superhero, is implemented in almost every storyline possible, even in stories where he is out of place such as in the Justice League Dark film, and where he is portrayed as a person who is almost perfect and just in every way, almost like a super-righteous knight.

The most common example that comes to mind is how Batman seems to have been ""fanboy""-ied into being the kind of hero that can anyone with preparation and resources, no matter how powerful or smart or numerous his opponents are.

Or that no matter what Batman thinks or does, no matter how dark his thoughts may be or how brutal or shocking his methods are, he is considered as always the right and the hero of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

However, being that Batman is meant to be a human being who has limits in terms of power when compared to meta beings, he is meant to represent to flaw nature of humanity - our way of thinking, and our way of life, as Batman was raised in human culture and is most familiar with the shockingly brutal reality of Gotham and Arkham.

But even though Batman is meant to be a human being and even if he is identified as a genius and implements logic in his methods and principles such as in his ""no-killing"" rule and is very aware of himself, I do not think that we often see Batman being placed in positions where he is provoked to question my morals, principles or even his sanity considering how blurry and conveniently human they are (at least, not in mainstream media).

We managed to have storylines where Batman was provoked to be in this position a couple of times such as in the Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, in the Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth story, in the Long Halloween storyline, or in The Joker: Devil's Advocate story, or one instance in the Killing Joke, 

But it seems that every time the Dark Knight is portrayed, at least in most mainstream media, Batman is worshipped in almost every way and that no matter what his actions and ideas are, he is always the hero - in the Lego Batman film is where we find this most prominently where his hero worship was used as the main driving humour of the story.

It is as though Batman is impervious to criticism and he is always the hero in the end - no matter if he was the extreme rebel in the Red Son story, or the brutal and narcissistic person in the All-Star storyline and in the Dark Knight Returns, or how thorough and defensive he was in the Tower of Babel story where he made contingency plans for every Justice League member without their knowledge, or no matter what parenting style he uses to the Robin family (usually done in a very disciplinary manner which the Red Hood sometimes uses as an excuse for his anger towards Batman)

&amp;#x200B;

It feels ironic that these beings are portrayed in almost opposite ways than what they are meant to be where Batman is meant human at his core and being human means being flawed, while Superman is meant to be perfect but meant to be a representation of an ideal despite his almost omnipotent existence",0,"Would it make sense to say that Superman has been reduced to a simple hero with godly abilities and not focused on the ideals that he represents, while Batman is continuously glorified as a perfect being in every way without focusing on his flawed humanity?

1655716193,TranslatesToScottish,"DC Infinite App (iOS) - Can someone help, or am I just being really stupid?","Hi folks

Sorry to ask this, at the risk of seeming dumb, but the app feels really unintuitive to use in certain ways and so I was hoping someone could help.

I'm trying to read collected storylines from their own suggested storylines, but I'm having a problem with getting the comics to keep loading in reading order.

For instance, if there's a storyline which spans over multiple series, let's say for simplicity the story order is;

Batman 1, Batman 2, JLA 1, Batman 3, JLA 2, Robin 1, Batman 4

when I select the storyline in question, it shows all the various books initially, but when I start to read, I'll get through Batman 1 and 2 ok, but when I hit ""read next"" from Batman 2, it jumps right to Batman 3, rather than JLA 1, if that makes sense?

Is there a way to do this that actually follows the reading order when hitting ""read next"" rather than the issue order of the current series?

1655695766,beary_good,July 2022 Book Club Nomination - Original Graphic Novels,"Here, we'll vote for the book to be featured in the July Book Club. You may nominate or upvote books that you wish to discuss. **Do not nominate more than one book, and do not post a duplicate nomination.**    

Like with our Character of the Month polls, each poll will have a particular theme or category. This week's category is: **Original Graphic Novels**. Nominate stories that were published not as serialized comic issues, but directly as full-length graphic novels. They may be original graphic novels, or extended one-shots that are collected and published by themselves as standalone books.

Guidelines for book eligibility are as follows:  

- The book must be widely available in-print. This means that I should be able to go to an online retailer like Amazon, InStockTrades, or Book Depository and buy it without paying an exorbitant markup. 

- The book must be available digitally (ie, Comixology, DC Universe, or Hoopla Digital), either as a complete collection or individual issues. It must be available through **legal means**; do not post a piracy site.  
- The book should be reasonably affordable. Paperback trades, hardcovers, and Deluxe Editions are fine. Absolutes and Omnibuses are not.  
- If you're nominating a story arc, be sure to include the trade where it's collected. Do not nominate a single issue or Annual.  
- Limit your nomination to a single collection or graphic novel. Don't just nominate an entire run; pick out one particular volume. Under certain circumstances, we may allow two volumes from a single creative run to be nominated, if they're reasonably short and tell a complete story (e.g., a 12-issue mini-series split up into two trades). However, this is left to moderator discretion.  
- Anything published by DC is eligible. That includes main-line comics, graphic novels, imprints (such as Vertigo), media tie-ins, and others.  
- Only nominate a book if you're genuinely interested in reading and discussing it. There's no prize for picking the most popular answer.

They have a catalogue of every DC book released and their covers. I decided I would start at Crisis on Infinite Earths and go from there. I read through the DC infinite compilation and then plugged in the date at the end to mikes(somewhere around 1986, too lazy to check forgive me) and sorted by publication date.

I read about 15-20 of the titles from each month skipping ones that arent on the app or that dont really interest me. Ill read one, go back to the mikes page and find the next. Im at the tale end of 1988 and having a great time reading some lesser known runs or old classics Ive missed. 

Its a big undertaking but I have enjoyed myself immensely and reccomend this to anyone looking for a big project.

**Superman #8**

**Story 1**

Two scientist have discovered a method of making creatures gigantic.  So what are they going to do now?  Naturally, they're going to turn humans into giant to take over the world!  Said giant humans begin terrorizing the countryside, getting the attention of the Daily Planet, who send both Lois and Clark.  Clark however, decides to ditch her and go as Superman.  He flies over and sees massive the massive humans building homes on a mountain.  Meanwhile, at the governor's mansion, a giant breaks in and kidnaps both him and his daughter (feels like he should have known about the giants????).  Superman attempts to sneak into the extinct volcano where the giants have made their home, but a massive siren emits a message, saying if he if wanted to continue his ""altruistic existence"" (HAHA!  Since when?) he should back off.  Superman rebuffs this, but is attacked by one of the giants.  Superman however, flies down and breaks his toe, causing the giant to hop around.  More giants come running, so Superman triggers an avalanche.  While everything is coming down, one of the giants grabs him and gets buried under snow.  The scientist declares the death of Superman (come guys, really?).  Right at the moment, however, Lois is flying over in a plane, get grabbed by one of the giants and kidnapped.  Superman breaks out of the ice.  Superman attempts to break into the lab, but is caught by a giant once again.  The scientists offer to let Superman join them, but he rebuffs them and they begin turning both Lois and the governor's daughters into giants.  Superman decides to heck with all of this, escapes the giant, grabs a BIG ROCK, and slams it into the top of the volcano and SETS IT OFF.  As all the glaciers melt and the mountain floods, the giants panic and try to run away, crushing the scientists.  Superman breaks back into the lab, smashes the glass between himself and the kidnapped women, and discovers that it was a trick, and the women are fine.  He then grabs everyone and flies away while the giants are buried and killed by the avalanche.

You know what, kudos to Superman.  I was genuinely entertained by this comic and not just in an ironic way.  It's probably because these giants are the first real threat to Superman since the comic began.  I know they're working their way up to giving him real villains and not just ones he breaks into twigs any time they anger him.  It was nice to see hints of it, and I look forward to seeing more.  It also helps that this was what I thought comics were going to be like before I started and not just, you know, Superman being a menace to society by destroying Metropolis and fighting the national guard.  And just to add on, SUPERMAN CAUSED A VOLCANO TO ERUPT.  For corn's sake Superman, you have no idea how much damage that would cause!  It could Mt. St. Helens or Krakatoa all over again!  But oh no!  Let's just DESTROY A MOUNTAIN TO SAVE THREE PEOPLE.  God I love this man.

**Story 2**

Clark is being spied upon through his apartment window, but before he can deal with that, an old friend who is ""connected with anti-espionage service"" knocks on his door.  He tells Clark that a dangerous spy is coming to Metropolis by boat and he wants Clark to investigate.  Clark to decides to go as Superman and flies to the port.  The spy sent to coordinate attacks on the USA is named Eric Reibel (COME ON GUYS!  FOR REAL?).  He tries to get his men to spread dangerous leaflets while  striking a um...Notzi pose, only for Superman to break in and destroy the leaflets.  They try to beat him and you can bet how that goes.  Superman then GRABS A GUN AND SHOOTS THE REIBEL GUY, although he manages to jump in front of the bullet and stops it, threatening that if he doesn't stop he'll let it hit him.  Clark attempts to go meet his old friend, but he hears a shot outside of his office.  I turns out, the man that had been watching him was his friend's assistant and has killed his employer.  Just as the cops arrive, however, the killer throws the gun to Clark (who catches it like an idiot) and the assistant blames him.  They find in Clark's pocket a list of the spies and saboteurs and they arrest him.  Clark escapes and returns as Superman as starts following Reibel.  He and the spy end up in an isolated place in some mountains where Superman discovers them gathering and training an army to attack the US.  There, the leader who is not at all drawn like a stereotypical Notzi, says that the assistant that framed Clark is now one of their agents in the Anti-Espionage Service.  Naturally, Superman sneaks into the tent and breaks into the safe to get the documents.  A soldier tries to bayonette him, and Superman wraps the gun around his body to tie him up (AWESOME).  The whole camp is then scrambled where Superman fights through men, planes, and artillery.  He then flies over their munitions plant, and contemplates not attacking it would kill everyone.  Fortunately for that moral conundrum (and the Golden Age kill count), a stray shell whizzes by him and suddenly forgetting he has super speed, he allows it to hit the munitions plant and explode, killing everyone.  Turning back to Clark, he returns to Metropolis and KIDNAPS THE ASSISTANT AT GUNPOINT.  He takes him back to the Daily Planet where he gets the man to confess, but Lois points out that a coerced confession won't stand up.  Clark, however, hands over the document from the Notzi camp, showing the assistant's involvement.  The man is arrested and all is well.

At least Superman isn't fight the United States armed forced this time!  Actual panels of action seem to be surprisingly rare in early Superman, all things considered.  Showing him causing wonton destruction to people he should be is actually quite satisfying.  I just hope he sticks with the um...uh...Notzis and not America.  Then again, he's already caused millions of dollars worth of damage to America, so why stop now?  Also, I didn't think they were ever going to address this, but since Lois brought it up: yeah, how do ANY of the confessions Superman gets admissible and not under duress?  He basically takes a criminal, throws him around a bit, and then threatens to kill them to get a confession.  Anything they say to the police would be thrown out because Superman threatened them to get it.  I wasn't going to say anything because, you know, ""comic book logic LOL!"" but THEY were the ones to bring it up!  Way to poke holes in your own mythology guys!

Story 3

Clark has taken Lois to a carnival where they are actually having a good time.  One of the carnival barkers, however, ropes Clark into playing a rigged game.

**Superman #8**

**Story 1**

Two scientist have discovered a method of making creatures gigantic.  So what are they going to do now?  Naturally, they're going to turn humans into giant to take over the world!  Said giant humans begin terrorizing the countryside, getting the attention of the Daily Planet, who send both Lois and Clark.  Clark however, decides to ditch her and go as Superman.  He flies over and sees massive the massive humans building homes on a mountain.  Meanwhile, at the governor's mansion, a giant breaks in and kidnaps both him and his daughter (feels like he should have known about the giants????).  Superman attempts to sneak into the extinct volcano where the giants have made their home, but a massive siren emits a message, saying if he if wanted to continue his ""altruistic existence"" (HAHA!  Since when?) he should back off.  Superman rebuffs this, but is attacked by one of the giants.  Superman however, flies down and breaks his toe, causing the giant to hop around.  More giants come running, so Superman triggers an avalanche.  While everything is coming down, one of the giants grabs him and gets buried under snow.  The scientist declares the death of Superman (come guys, really?).  Right at the moment, however, Lois is flying over in a plane, get grabbed by one of the giants and kidnapped.  Superman breaks out of the ice.  Superman attempts to break into the lab, but is caught by a giant once again.  The scientists offer to let Superman join them, but he rebuffs them and they begin turning both Lois and the governor's daughters into giants.  Superman decides to heck with all of this, escapes the giant, grabs a BIG ROCK, and slams it into the top of the volcano and SETS IT OFF.  As all the glaciers melt and the mountain floods, the giants panic and try to run away, crushing the scientists.  Superman breaks back into the lab, smashes the glass between himself and the kidnapped women, and discovers that it was a trick, and the women are fine.  He then grabs everyone and flies away while the giants are buried and killed by the avalanche.

You know what, kudos to Superman.  I was genuinely entertained by this comic and not just in an ironic way.  It's probably because these giants are the first real threat to Superman since the comic began.  I know they're working their way up to giving him real villains and not just ones he breaks into twigs any time they anger him.  It was nice to see hints of it, and I look forward to seeing more.  It also helps that this was what I thought comics were going to be like before I started and not just, you know, Superman being a menace to society by destroying Metropolis and fighting the national guard.  And just to add on, SUPERMAN CAUSED A VOLCANO TO ERUPT.  For corn's sake Superman, you have no idea how much damage that would cause!  It could Mt. St. Helens or Krakatoa all over again!  But oh no!  Let's just DESTROY A MOUNTAIN TO SAVE THREE PEOPLE.  God I love this man.

**Story 2**

Clark is being spied upon through his apartment window, but before he can deal with that, an old friend who is ""connected with anti-espionage service"" knocks on his door.  He tells Clark that a dangerous spy is coming to Metropolis by boat and he wants Clark to investigate.  Clark to decides to go as Superman and flies to the port.  The spy sent to coordinate attacks on the USA is named Eric Reibel (COME ON GUYS!  FOR REAL?).  He tries to get his men to spread dangerous leaflets while  striking a um...Notzi pose, only for Superman to break in and destroy the leaflets.  They try to beat him and you can bet how that goes.  Superman then GRABS A GUN AND SHOOTS THE REIBEL GUY, although he manages to jump in front of the bullet and stops it, threatening that if he doesn't stop he'll let it hit him.  Clark attempts to go meet his old friend, but he hears a shot outside of his office.  I turns out, the man that had been watching him was his friend's assistant and has killed his employer.  Just as the cops arrive, however, the killer throws the gun to Clark (who catches it like an idiot) and the assistant blames him.  They find in Clark's pocket a list of the spies and saboteurs and they arrest him.  Clark escapes and returns as Superman as starts following Reibel.  He and the spy end up in an isolated place in some mountains where Superman discovers them gathering and training an army to attack the US.  There, the leader who is not at all drawn like a stereotypical Notzi, says that the assistant that framed Clark is now one of their agents in the Anti-Espionage Service.  Naturally, Superman sneaks into the tent and breaks into the safe to get the documents.  A soldier tries to bayonette him, and Superman wraps the gun around his body to tie him up (AWESOME).  The whole camp is then scrambled where Superman fights through men, planes, and artillery.  He then flies over their munitions plant, and contemplates not attacking it would kill everyone.  Fortunately for that moral conundrum (and the Golden Age kill count), a stray shell whizzes by him and suddenly forgetting he has super speed, he allows it to hit the munitions plant and explode, killing everyone.  Turning back to Clark, he returns to Metropolis and KIDNAPS THE ASSISTANT AT GUNPOINT.  He takes him back to the Daily Planet where he gets the man to confess, but Lois points out that a coerced confession won't stand up.  Clark, however, hands over the document from the Notzi camp, showing the assistant's involvement.  The man is arrested and all is well.

At least Superman isn't fight the United States armed forced this time!  Actual panels of action seem to be surprisingly rare in early Superman, all things considered.  Showing him causing wonton destruction to people he should be is actually quite satisfying.  I just hope he sticks with the um...uh...Notzis and not America.  Then again, he's already caused millions of dollars worth of damage to America, so why stop now?  Also, I didn't think they were ever going to address this, but since Lois brought it up: yeah, how do ANY of the confessions Superman gets admissible and not under duress?  He basically takes a criminal, throws him around a bit, and then threatens to kill them to get a confession.  Anything they say to the police would be thrown out because Superman threatened them to get it.  I wasn't going to say anything because, you know, ""comic book logic LOL!"" but THEY were the ones to bring it up!  Way to poke holes in your own mythology guys!

Story 3

Clark has taken Lois to a carnival where they are actually having a good time.  One of the carnival barkers, however, ropes Clark into playing a rigged game.  After a while, Clark tries to quit, but they force him to pay eight dollars.  Playing the weenie, Clark pays and Lois is disgusted.   Lois decides to run an expose on those guys because I guess all the spies and giants are defeated so we need to go after carnival barkers!  Clark says not to do it, but decides Superman should handle these...two-bit hucksters, I guess?  Lois catches proof, but gets caught and they destroy her camera.  She goes to the owner of the carnival who acts out firing the guys, but secretly he's in on too.  The carnival workers later corner a guy who wouldn't pay up and start beating him, but Superman swoops in.  They try to stab him , but Superman TAKES THE KNIFE AND EATS IT (THAT WAS COOL).  He beats them up and sticks their heads through one of those ball-throwing boards and then throws baseballs at them like a psychopath.

He then beats them up to get confessions (which the last comic established are inadmissible) and Lois gets a policeman to arrest them.

1655516490,JosephMeach,Y'all got any of that...Clark Kent Superboy Chronology?,"Hey people, I have been collecting Superboy back issues (and the small number of reprints that exist) lately, and I had a question for people who are maybe not new at this:  


\- After the More Fun Comics run, in Adventure Comics #103 (1946) it is Clark's 10th birthday.

\- In the earliest issues of Superboy that I have (early 1950s) he attends Smallville High School, goes on dates, etc.

\- In The New Adventures of Superboy #1 (1980) it is his 16th birthday. Right before that, in Superboy/Legion #258-259, he leaves the Legion in order to not learn too much about his own future. 

\- In Superman: The Secret Years (1985) he transitions from Superboy to Superman, during college.  


So my question is, do all of the Legion adventures happen before his 16th birthday, or is the New Adventures of Superboy (I haven't read it yet) modern retellings of stuff from Volume 1? Has anyone put together a Superboy chronology that might include Adventure Comics?

1655476931,DasEmperor,It's 2022. Here's what I think of the Justice League cast.,"Not Justice League the movie, Justice League the cast. Also this doesn't include Zachary Levi as Shazam even though he was incredible in Shazam, nor does it include Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, even though she was incredible in that role. This is just the Justice League members.

**Henry Cavill as Superman**

This one's a bummer for me because you have a giant nerd playing a giant jock. Henry Cavill was built to play Batman but he signed on as Superman and played it as Batman-like as possible, and part of that's Zach Snider being emo and trying to subvert the character, eventually coming up with something that is equidistant from the comics and Brightburn, but still. Superman's the kind of guy who simultaneously wants to save the world, and help an old lady across the street. Henry Cavill's superman wanted to... make out with Lois Lane, and help his mom from a distance. He's not personable, and he lives in an isolated awkward bubble with few people who can get close. 

In conclusion, I think a reboot here would do the character some good.

**Ben Afflek as Batman**

Might as well be Henry Cavill playing both roles, honestly. This Batman is violent and stoic, and has the bonus of tossing out every possible memorable Batman moment and skipping right to the end. At least Henry Cavill's Superman had the distinction of being allowed to have relationships. Seriously the most personable thing this iteration does is save Harley in Suicide Squad after he punches her in the face. Batman's not a loner. He's the kind of weirdo that adopts an orphan because said orphan stole his hubcaps, and another one who tried to murder him. He's got some dad energy and I don't think Ben Afflek (or possibly the sort of middle ground scripts that he got) allowed him to play the role of a guy who honestly wants the best for the next generation.

**Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman**

Honest to goodness I hope Gal Gadot is still playing Wonder Woman at like 80 years old. I went back and watched some of the old Lynda Carter Wonder Woman show, and it's good, but I retroactively see Gal Gadot as the correct Wonder Woman choice. 

**Jason Mamoa as Aquaman**

The best part of the Aquaman movie was definitely Aquaman himself. I like the interpretation of Aquaman as the big, aggressive seeming dudebro, and I think Jason Mamoa really plays it up so well. My favorite part of the whole movie was that scene at the beginning in the bar, when him and these bikers look like they're sizing each other up, then wind up on a wild night of drinking and laughing. Absolute gold. Jason Mamoa is going to be tough to replace.

**Ezra Miller as the Flash**

Ezra Miller has this kind of nervous energy that works for the role... but it also works for someone who took a lot of drugs and groomed children. Since apparently the second one seems to be true, that's literally all I can see now, and I think they could replace him with any given skinny guy and have an equally valid Flash. I don't think Evan Peters is doing anything right now. He was a good Quicksilver. Why not Flash?

**Ray Fisher as Cyborg**

He's... stoic. I don't really have a whole lot of positive or negative stuff to say about the guy. He played the character. He did it. He said all the lines and was in the places he needed to be, but if they pulled a War Machine on him, I wouldn't feel anything in particular about it. I think if the dude gets a movie, he's going to need to get a writer who's very different from Zach Snider and Joss Whedon, who's able to humanize an actor a lot more. I think Ray Fisher's personality gets washed out in the big action packed fight scenes in a way that the other actors don't, but also it's hard to find other stuff with him in it, since he's a pretty new actor. He might still be trying to figure himself out. I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that he seems a lot more robotic than I expected from a character literally called Cyborg.

**Conclusion**

I have nothing against any of these actors, except maybe Ezra Miller after the allegations. That being said, I think Gal Gadot and Jason Mamoa are the absolute keepers, and the rest could theoretically be replaced. We're getting a new Batman, who knows about Superman, Flash, and Cyborg, but I do think jumping into a high stakes movie with the strongest heroes was a bit too soon. Marvel jumped into the Avengers with 4 of the 6 having gotten their own movie (the other two appearing in other movies) and the villain having appeared as a villain in a previous film. It's not like Joss Whedon suddenly forgot how to make a successful superhero movie, it's more that Joss Whedon was given a setup for 2012's Avengers that is not hard to succeed with. 

So yeah. I think anything else Justice League is too soon. I think we need an upbeat non-emo Superman, a Batman who can hold down relationships (but not romance), a Flash who acts heroic, and a Cyborg who gets excited about things happening.

Pyrrhos joing clark, jon, lois and the rest of the family can maybe try to fill the void jon left behind when he was aged up. And of course, he would mirror damian in being the son of a hero and a villain and being entitles to lead the family. This could be a new arc for damian as he sees who he used to be in Pyrrhos and try to do for Pyrrhos what others did for him. Do you guys think Pyrrhos will show up in canon or is he a future state exclusive?

* [**Fatale**](https://media.comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fatale_001_5th.jpg), by Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips 

When discussing crime fiction comics, it’s impossible to not bring up the all-star creative team of Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips. Fatale is no different as the duo effortlessly craft a story with hardboiled detective overtones, combined with otherworldly and supernatural elements of Lovecraftian horror. The narrative takes the classic film noir trope of the femme fatale, and reworks it to be at the forefront of a dark mystery involving violence, cults, and tentacle monsters.

So, what are *you* reading?

\-------

After seeing the 18th retailer exclusive variant cover for the Poison Ivy mini-series that just came out earlier this month, I started to get a sense of maybe how ironic it was that we've got all these Pride-based books promoting LGBTQIA+ and the only Pride-based book getting retailer variants is Poison Ivy. Goes to show where the market is at from a sexuality perspective? (i.e. heterosexual men with a secondary audience of anyone else who sexually prefers women)

We didn't get any retailer variants for the Pride 2022 collection nor the Tim Drake Special that just came out this week, and I'd argue the stories in each of those books were just as great to read. To try to be mildly objective, I wouldn't think Poison Ivy (and Harley Quinn) are more popular than the sum of all the characters shown in the Pride 2022 collection combined? 

Does this suggest that the Pride books don't sell? Or are retailers who pitch for exclusives not into the Pride scene and even, dare I say, homophobic? Or is DC holding back on retailers making exclusive covers for Pride-based books this month (with clear exception to Poison Ivy...)? It just seems ironic that there's this big Pride agenda from DC/Marvel/other publishers and retailers don't seem to be making an effort to promote that? Retailer exclusive variants are usually an indication of which books are expected to sell, at least based on the assumption that retailers have purposely invested in exclusive cover artwork to sell a unique version of the book, so the decision to offer an exclusive cover is calculated to some degree.",0,"Exclusive variant covers going against Pride initiatives?

**Superman #7**

**Story 4**

The cover of this story has man being shot while striking a ballerina-like pose, just thought I would put that out there.  Apparently a gang called the Black Gang (IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK) has been terrorizing the city.  A reporter from a rival newspaper named Peter Peeker (oh for the love of...!)  has been getting the scoop on them.  Naturally, the editor of the Daily Planet says Lois and Clark needs to get a scoop on them or they're fired, like a good boss would do.  So Lois and Clark decide to go undercover as socialites to a local night club where the Black Gang strikes.  Lois dyes her hair blonde and Clark takes off his glasses, although Lois still doesn't recognize him as Superman (great reporter she is!)  At the club, Lois makes Clark shell out money like it's going out of style to draw attention to themselves.  They attract the attention of Peter Peeker (DON'T DO IT!  DON'T MAKE THE JOKE.  YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS).  Believing him to be rich. a woman spends time time with Clark, and eventually asks him to take her home.  On the way, the car is ambushed by the black gang (BECAUSE OF THE BLACK HOODS), but Clark flees and quickly changes into Superman.  Peter Peeker (JUST GONNA CLENCH MY TEETH)  offers to drive Lois to a better club, but instead drives them to the Black Gang's hideout, showing he was working for them.  They find out who Lois is, attempt to kill her, and Superman busts in to stop them.  He then ""makes them dance"" by throwing bullets at their feet like the great guy he is before tying them up and calling the police.  Clark and Lois then write up the story about the dirty reporter.

WHEW!  The names they pick for people.  I already had one meltdown over GAY CITY (HAHAHAHAHAHA!) we don't need another one.  I'm really beginning to wonder why Clark has such a thing for Lois.  They go to the club because it was her idea and then she makes him hemorrhage money just to get attention.  He even gave out a $20 bill, which in today's money would be $787! (Shut-up!  Don't question my math!) He's said numerous times that he likes that Lois sticking her nose into things and getting into trouble, but at the same time she's NEVER nice to him because she thinks he's a weenie.  However, he acts like a weenie to keep her from thinking he's Superman.  This brings up two possibilities: one, he could not work for the Daily Planet so she would never think that, or two, he could just date her as Superman.  Then again, logic was never the strong suit for Mr. Let's-destroy-a-section-of-Metropolis-that's-poor man!

**Action Comics #30, Cover date: November 1940**

It's summer in Metropolis, but the city is covered by a blizzard!  Clark goes to interview the weatherman, but he has no explanation.  Suddenly, a woman over the radio says she has information on why it's frozen over and will only tell it to Superman.  Clark is sent to the location with Lois butting in and deciding to scoop the story.  A woman arrives along with a blonde companion at the metting site.  A car pulls up full with...uh...let's say um...less than flattering drawings of Arabic people?  Abruptly they fire a mechanism at her that launches a glowing ball of light.  When it hits her, she disentigrates!  A policeman comes running, but they shoot and dissolve him too!  Then Lois arrives, and finally Superman swoops in and rescues her.  The, let's say Middle-Eastern men then grab the blonde woman that had come originally and threaten to kill her.  Superman, apparently forgetting he has super speed, grabs Lois and bounds away.  We then briefly cut to to the Sahara desert where a man named Carlton Vogel has found the lost city of Ulonda, before he can celebrate, men come by on horses, firing those balls of light and disintegrating them.  The men who attack say their leader is Zolar.  Back in the present, the Middle-Eastern gentlemen attempt to get the blonde woman into a rocket.  They fire that globe thing at Superman, but it only knocks him unconscious, so they take him too.  Later, he wakes up to find he and the blonde woman are chained up.  It turns out, she's Laura Vogel, brother of the guy who found the city and they are looking for a guy named Zolar.  Apparently Zolar has great stores of radium which apparently powers his ray gun and weather controlling machines.  Laura then gives a bizarre reason for the snowfall, in that Zolar's people said she had until the first snowfall in Metropolis to tell them where the lost city was, and then made it snow???  Moving on...Zolar then appears in a screen with his GIANT FACE, but despite the fact that he's a bald mad scientist, he is NOT in fact, Lex Luthor.  They then arrive at Zolar's fortress where Superman goes crazy and starts wrecking stuff.  To get him to stop, Zolar starts dropping glowing orbs on Ulonda,  Superman, leaps onto Zolar's rocket and demands Zolar order HIS SHIPS TO CRASH WITH THE PEOPLE ON IT.  ZOLAR COMPLIES AND ALL OF HIS SHIPS CRASH TO THE GROUND (OH MY FREAKIN' GOD!!!!).  It is then revealed that Laura is in fact working for Zolar, and the first woman that had been vaporized was originally Luara.  She launches one of the orbs at Superman, but, again, it only knocks Superman out.  It then bounces back and hits Zolar and the woman, vaporizing them both.  Superman wakes up and returns to Metrolopis where the weather has returned to normal.

OKAY!  OKAY!  SUPERMAN STRAIGHT UP KILLED PEOPLE!  THIS ISN'T LIKE ""OH A RICHOCHET BOUNCED OFF AND HIT THE BAD GUY.""  NO!  HE ORDERED A GUY TO TO CRASH HIS ROCKETS FULL OF PEOPLE AND THEN THE EVIL GENIUS JUST...DOES IT?????  WHAT IN THE MADNESS OF CORN COB IS THIS?  DID NO ONE BRING THIS UP IN THE WRITING ROOM?  I can't even add to the Golden Age kill count because there's no telling how many people Superman killed!  That was a monstrous thing to do!  And the fact that the bad guy was just like ""OKAY!"" like Superman would just let him get away after that?  Also, logic didn't exactly prevail in this issue did it?  I get that the blonde woman wasn't really Laura, but the story about the first snowfall was kinda...dumb?  They didn't have to freeze Metropolis, they could have just put a gun to Laura's head and make her talk.  There was no reason to do winter in July just to draw attention to yourself!  Also also, and I don't want to harp on this point too much, but the Arabic people have like...green skin for some reason???  Like, I can't tell if that's racist or like a color error?  This was one bonkers, violent, nonsensical Superman comic and I can't even comprehend how they thought it would work!

More of this please.  I NEED THIS.  INJECT IT DIRECTLY INTO MY VEINS.

**Action Comics #31, Cover date: December 1940**

Clark and Lois are on vacation together (but apparently not as a couple, I guess?) and they decide to go to the small town of Brentville to relax.  When they get there, however, everyone in the twon is dead asleep, and Lois follows soon after.  Clark goes to a fire station where they apparently have gas masks and puts them on himself and Lois.  He then drives to the edge of town where the gas (he never got confirmation it was gas???) might be lighter.  He finds a house and tries to use the telephone of a professor.  The professor's assistant, however, attempts to hit Clark over the head with a wrench, which obviously doesn't work.  Lois wakes up, but she and Clark spot a car full of people in gas masks driving down the street.  They tail it to find they are breaking into a bank.  Lois rushes in, but they take her mask off and she drops unconscious.  This allows Clark to change into Superman.  He beats them up and takes off their masks, dropping them like flies.  More people come to investigate the town, but all keep falling asleep on the street.  The police arrive in gas masks, and find Lois and Clark.  They accuse them of being a part of this, but Clark says he was the one that phoned them and to go check with the professor.  Only the assistant is there, and he calls Clark a liar, getting them both arrested and locked in a room.  Clark knocks out Lois with a nerve pinch and turns into Superman.  It turns out, someone is filling the room with Hydrocyanic Acid.  He breaks out and carries Lois away.  When Superman returns, he discovers that the assistant has been working with a foreign agent to get the sleeping gas for his country.  The gangster who were trying to rob the bank worked for the assistant and weren't part of the original plan.  Superman decides to dig under the house and create a tunnel from the outside (I mean...okay?) and finds the professor in the cellar.  Superman escape with him, but returns to find that the foreign agent, now named Munsdorf, and the assistant have come to the cellar.  Seeing that the professor has escaped, the agent shoots the assistant.  Munsdorf whips out a ""ultra-modern atomic gun"" and shoot him.  It doesn't affect Superman, so Munsdorf then fires it at a nearby house where Lois just so happens to be.  Superman rushes to save her, but when he returns Munsdorf is attacking the professor.  Superman blocks the ray and in a confusing panel either it ricochets back and kills him or Superman touched the man and he died.  Either way: Golden Age Superman Kill Count: 13.  Clark wants to continue with the vacation after that, but Lois wants to rush back to Metropolis for the story.

Another day, another kill for our beloved hero!  Sometimes they try to make it not Superman's fault, and other times he's just a merciless killer annihilating people on a whim.  The hero of the people, am I right?  This is the second comic in a short time that involves a poison gas that kills people, but with war looming I guess they're trying to reference the last big war, WWI, and the gas attacks.  That being said, there were suddenly a lot of gas masks in this story.  Did firemen and cops in 1940 have gas masks so easily on hand?  I know that now they do, but it feels like that wouldn't be a thing quite yet.   Also, Lois literally ran towards an explosion in a town full of poison gas.  Not the sharpest reporter in the newsroom is she?  Also also, were Clark and Lois going on a country getaway to bang?  I mean, it's 1940 and this is for kids, so I don't think that was the implication, but in 2022 it certainly SOUNDS like they were going to.

1655341866,inklingboi08,Why is the DC Multiverse so not connected?,"What I mean is that, in the Marvel multiverse, no one universe has the same designation (aside from MoM calling the MCU Earth-616 because I'm convinced the writers don't actually read comics. So does the actress for Kamala Khan, look it up). It's one whole multiverse with each timeline and adaptation being different universes.

I was hoping see if anyone knew a good list / website that shows what DC graphic novels / compilation books / comic runs have been released when etc.  For the last decade or so, I seem to basically let 2-3 years worth of content pile up, then order a million ""volume compilations"" from the library and catch up.

I keep a list of what issue the volume compilations ended on, so I end up with a list like this (only much longer):

Justice League 	43  
Justice League Dark	19  
Justice League Odyssey	18

I feel like I'm probably caught up to 2019-2020 depending on the title...  But I'm finding the recent releases don't seem as interested in maintaining the ""Batman vol 7"", ""Batman vol 8"" format, and tend to shunt individual story/titles into like story compilations, which is making it harder to build a ""shopping list"" for the library, and pick up where I left off.

1655256615,Some-Dog9800,Day two of making my way down this subreddit's recommended comics list: Batgirl - Year One,"Hi, yesterday I started a series where I go down this subreddit's [list of recommended comics for newbies](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/wiki/recommended/newbies) and review one item each day. Yesterday's entry was about Aquaman Volume 1 - The Trench by Geoff Johns. You can read that entry [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/wiki/recommended/newbies). Today's item was Batgirl - Year One by Chuck Dixon and Scott Beatty. It tells the story of Barbara's journey to becoming Batgirl.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I haven't read Batgirl as much as I've read Batman but I tend to really enjoy the Batgirl books I do read (except whatever the fuck that new Birds of Prey run was), and this was no exception (unlike THAT FUCKING BOP RUN). I really love her character and I find the whole concept behind Barbara super interesting. I like the way her relationship with Robin is depicted (I'm a DickBabs shipper, fight me), and I loved how Barbara developed over the course of this story. I particularly loved Dixon and Beatty's portrayal of Killer Moth, they made him come off sort of pathetic and down on his luck like an alchoholic Spider-Man dressed like a Beetle. I was kind of rooting for him at times. Firefly came off really menacing and unhinged which played well with Killer Moth's characterization. It seems like the new Batgirl movie will be borrowing elements from this run with Killer Moth and everything which just makes me even more excited. 

One thing I felt was a bit unnecessary was Black Canary's inclusion. She just kind of popped up and disappeared a few panels. At this point in the DC chronology, I don't know that Batman and the Justice League would even have a Watchtower yet, but maybe that's just my dumb headcanon getting in the way.

Make sure to leave your thoughts on this comic down below. I'll probably skip Hush since I've already read it about three times.

1655244871,nightwing612,Chris Jones and Greg Weisman answer fan questions on DCUI Forums to celebrate the release of Young Justice: Targets,"&amp;#x200B;

    Q1: will we see the Penguin on Young Justice? I’m a huge fan of the character and would love to see him on the show.:smiley:

GW: I’m afraid my answer to this - as to most of these kinds of questions - is NO SPOILERS. But we did MENTION Penguin in Phantoms. So at least you know an Earth-16 version of ol’ Oswald exists. 

    Q2: Who will be in the team? Will Greta Hayes be in it — asking for a friend :eyes:

GW: Targets takes place only a month after Phantoms! The roster of the Team will not have changed. 

    Q3: I was curious if this was an idea that got left out of the current season or a new idea that came about after the season was written. I love this show and hope for another season or at least more comic series.

GW: These are ideas which Brandon Vietti and I have had for some time…We’re finally getting around to “portraying” them in Targets. 

    Q4: I love that characters that first appeared in the original YJ tie-in comic series a decade ago like Wyynde, King Sha’ark, Blubber got to eventually show up in animation in YJ Seasons 3 and 4.
    
    Is YJ: Targets introducing any new characters that Chris got to design/draw that we may see again down the line in the animated series?

GW: YES!

CJ: Obviously that would be dependent on their being future seasons to appear in (#SaveEarth16), but we’ve already had characters from the previous tie-in comics make their way into the TV show, so it could certainly happen again! 

    Q5: Hey Greg and Chris, thanks for coming back! That was a really phenomenal season finale we just watched. I’ve got one question though – how were Zod and the other Phantom Zoners instantly able to address Metropolis in English when they emerged from the Boom Tube? Thanks!

GW: Ma’alefa’ak downloaded English to their minds!

    Q6: From what I’ve read online, it appears that each story will have a back up story as well. Will the backup be solo adventures of our heroes or villains from the past or team adventures filling in some gaps from the TV show, and was their a Young Justice character, you wanted to include more of but just didn’t have the space to do so.

GW: There are always characters that we want to devote more screen or page time to. Always. As for the back-ups, the first one focuses on Red Arrow. As for the other five… wait and see! 

    Q7: I don’t see the point in putting a question when mine never get asked but whatever. In hopefully future seasons, will you be continuing to focus on the OG Team?

GW: If you don’t ask, you can’t get an answer! :wink: We’ll always pay attention to the so-called OGs. But each season is intentionally different from past seasons. But the best way to show growth in the characters is to have earlier seasons’ versions of those characters to compare them to. 

    Q8: My question is I’m curious to why Vandal Savage was chosen as the big bad or an important one at least and will his plan continues to grow in these comics?

GW: Vandal’s historic history, going back 50K years made the idea of putting him up against young heroes extremely appealing to Brandon Vietti and myself. But that doesn’t guarantee that he’s involved with EVERY story. So I’m not going to reveal whether he is or isn’t involved in Targets. No spoilers! 

    Q9: I’m a bit confused on the timeline, which might just be because I’m stupid, but is the child that Ursa is pregnant with in the season finale supposed to be, genetically at least, a version of Lor-Zod? Or did the present day Ursa already give birth to Lor?

GW: The former, if I’m reading your question correctly. 

    Q10: When will you two work on the next Gargoyles?

CJ: Look closely at the pages of the second issue of YJ Targets for the answer to your question…

GW: There’s an Easter egg there just waiting to hatch… 

    Q11: Hi Greg and Chris!! I absolutely loved the finale of S4 and all the episodes and how we got to see the original team again. Will the YJ Targets series introduce any new characters that we have not seen before and will some team members have new outfits and or designs?

CJ: It’s been only a short time since the conclusion of Young Justice Season 4, so the designs and outfits are pretty much unchanged since Phantoms, but you ABSOLUTELY WILL be seeing some new characters in upcoming issues.

    Q12: what made you decide to give Conner only some of his power from the comic in this series.

GW: We wanted to go with 1938 Superman powers. Powers that were simply an extension and expansion of what a human could do. So Infrared vision, as opposed to heat vision. Super-leaping instead of flying, etc.

    Q13: What was it like voicing Lucas Carr and being the one marrying Miss M and SB? After all this time, did you feel something special when you finished recording the dialogue that closed up what was opened back in pretty much episode 2?

GW: It felt like the culmination of a decade’s worth of work, honestly. You can hear Lucas choke up, and truthfully, I choke up every time I watch that wedding, especially the vows. (And, yeah, I know that sounds immodest, since I wrote them, but all credit to Danica and Nolan for voicing them with so much sincere feeling!)

    Q14: I know you said numerous times there will never be a definitive ending to Young Justice, that you only do open-ended closure.
    But i have to know do you have a ending for the Darkseid Saga planned? Because i feel like it’s leading up to be essentially your Infinity Saga.

GW: We have plans for where we’re going for most of our storylines. But Darseid Is… 

    Q15: I absolutely loved the season 4 finale. I have a nitpick-y question regarding the wedding scene. Conner mentioned that everyone there was “in the know,” so I’m curious about how Wendy Harris and Harper &amp; Cullen Row found out (as in, who told them and when)? Thank you so much for your time and another wonderful season! Can’t wait to read Targets!

GW: Harper and Cullen were filled in when they moved in with foster parents Lucas and Bethany. Wendy figured it out. I’m not going to go into any more detail than that, because we might want to SHOW those scenes some day.

    Q16: How does it feel to see some of the characters you designed for the comic tie-in (Sha’lain’a, King Sha’ark, Wyynde, etc.) make the jump to the series in seasons 3 and 4?

CJ: It was amazing getting to see characters we introduced (the YJ versions at least) in the comic make their way into the TV show. With the characters from the Atlantis arc especially, those characters had to be aged up in adapting them for the TV show, and I got to help update the design for Ronal specifically! I’d love to see more “cross-pollination” between the TV show and comic if they both continue!

    Q17: With such a talented voice cast with the likes of Jessie McCartney, Troy Baker, Tara Strong, and more on the show, have you guys ever considered doing a musical episode for YJ, and do you think it is still in the cards for the future?

GW: We always include at least one song per season. And Chris and Kristopher Carter and I produced a YJ RadioPlay at CONvergence convention one year that was a full-on musical. ([You can find it on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ9Q4LJ3Lbk)) As for doing an actual musical episode of the show, I’d be game, but Brandon Vietti and I would have to find a valid reason - beyond just “Hey, wouldn’t this be fun (though a pain) to produce!” to make it actually fit into our fairly realistic Earth-16. 

    Q18: How much of the original 5-season plan is still intact?

GW: All of it, really. Keep in mind that plan was broad strokes. It wasn’t about little details. So we didn’t tweak anything on that broad strokes level based on the long hiatus.

    Q19: Will you guys be appearing in Comic Conventions in the East Coast this year?
    
    …and if you were given green light to do as you please within DC comics, how many more comics would you two put out right after Targets? How many more story arcs you already have in mind with these amazing characters in this amazing Earth 16?

GW: Personally, I haven’t been invited to any upcoming conventions anywhere, so… nope, I won’t be appearing. And I’d be willing to do as many comics as DC’ll let us do. REALLY, TRULY not worried about running out of stories.

CJ: I’m hoping to get to New York Comic Con this year. Between the pandemic and my schedule since moving to Los Angeles to work for Warner Brothers Animation I haven’t been able to get to a convention in a couple of years and I really miss getting to see fans!

And I’d always be down for more Young Justice comics if I could fit them into my schedule. I love these characters and never tire of helping tell their stories.

    Q20: Why did you make Hal suddenly look solder than his peers in YJ? He is actually younger than Bruce or Clark in comics.

GW: On Earth-16, Hal is actually a tad older than Clark and Bruce. But, really, the decision to have him be a bit gray at the temples was the choice of our original lead character designer and 3rd Season Art Director, Phil Bourassa. He suggested it, and Brandon Vietti and I said, sure.

    Q21: How long do you intend to keep teasing the return of Jason Todd?

GW: Who says he’s returning? :wink:

    Q22: Will we get to see more of wonder girl as she the leader of the outsiders ?!

GW: Yes. In Young Justice: Targets! Keep reading!

    Q23: Greg Weisman, will there be a sequel to Catwoman: Hunted?

GW: I have no idea, but I hope so. It was designed to be the first story in a trilogy of tales. We’ll just have to wait and see…

    Q24: Also, just wanna thank you for the representation of people with autism. I have it myself and I appreciate the whole arc about Rocket coming to understand her son through seeing Orion and how you acknowledge both the experiences of the autistic person himself and those of loved ones like parents. Man, I could go on and on and on about it lmao. Also just love all the representation in general. :00_dc_pride: :00_dc_pride_ps: :heart:

GW: Thanks. We’re always trying to increase the show’s representation on multiple fronts. We know how important it is to our fans. It’s important to us, as well.

    Q25: How is the process different when writing/drawing for the comics versus working on the show?

CJ: There’s a lot of overlap - it’s still drawing superheroes and visual storytelling. But instead of planning for movement in a static frame, you’re creating sequential art and having to figure out how to fit everything onto a page and allow room for dialog and make sure that the composition leads the eye across all the elements of the page in the correct order…there are a lot of differences!

GW: It’s not really all that different for me. It’s just about striving to tell stories in shorter chunks. A standard-length comic book issue is about the equivalent of 1/3 of an animated episode. And each page of a comic book needs to tell a mini-story of it’s own. Beyond that, I also need to keep in mind that I won’t have my voice cast to fall back upon, etc. And no ACTUAL movement, just the implication of movement. So I just have to remind myself to cover my bases differently.

    Q26: any new characters from this season going to be regulars in the next season? i liked megans family. they were fun to watch. hopefully more martians in season 5.

GW: No spoilers. (Assuming we get a next season.)

    Q27: will we see redhood in the series as we knew he died around season 2 it would be nice to see him.

GW: Who says you haven’t seen him? :wink:

&amp;#x200B;

CJ: Thanks for all the questions and thanks for supporting the show and the comic. We’d very much love to do more if there’s enough support for it!

Beyond that, I also need to keep in mind that I won’t have my voice cast to fall back upon, etc. And no ACTUAL movement, just the implication of movement. So I just have to remind myself to cover my bases differently.

    Q26: any new characters from this season going to be regulars in the next season? i liked megans family. they were fun to watch. hopefully more martians in season 5.

GW: No spoilers. (Assuming we get a next season.)

    Q27: will we see redhood in the series as we knew he died around season 2 it would be nice to see him.

GW: Who says you haven’t seen him? :wink:

&amp;#x200B;

CJ: Thanks for all the questions and thanks for supporting the show and the comic. We’d very much love to do more if there’s enough support for it!

GW: Out of time. But thanks for asking your questions. Hope you enjoyed the answers. Meanwhile, #KeepBingingYJ and READ #YoungJusticeTargets to help us #SaveEarth16!"

1655237096,YackleBerry,What exactly are the repercussions of ‘Final Crisis?,"*SPOILERS*


I’ve just finished the book (DC Essential Edition, if you’re curious) and I’m just very confused as to why it’s called a Crisis. Nothing Universal in scale was ultimately altered unless you count the death of Batman. I won’t lie the last Issue especially felt very all over the place and I was pretty much confused the entire way through it but I enjoyed all other six at least. 

To me it felt inconsequential by the end, Superman had wished for the universe to be put together and aside from Batman being “killed” everything seems like it was put back to normal by the end maybe I’m missing something? 

COIE ended with all universes bar one being destroyed 

Zero Hour ended with Parallax essentially winning and displacing time

Infinite Crisis ended with the Multiverse coming back 

And Final Crisis…..what exactly? 

Maybe i’m just being really stupid and missed something, I admittedly did feel myself zoning out quite a bit by the 7th issue but I was just wondering if someone could explain to me what impact Final Crisis exactly had.",0,"What exactly are the repercussions of ‘Final Crisis? *SPOILERS*

From what I read, I get why he would want to become a vigilante, he seems to want to make up for the mistakes of his past, and has an issue with the wealth gap. Sure, that I get. But why be batman, though? He has the training, yes, but so far as I can tell, he is batman, because he randomly found one of his suits. Really, even in that issue, his friend called him out on his bullshit. No one thought batman was really dead, it was just a weak excuse, which I have no clue why he would need or want. And, OK, say he just took the costume and went for it, because he wanted to be heroic and protect his identity for the moment. Why not modify the costume afterwards, and call himself something else?

1655169909,TheBatmanWhoChuckles,My thoughts on what a shared DC Movie Universe could look like,"While I’ve enjoyed more of DC’s recent movie offerings, as a huge fan of DC, I still wish they could’ve built a more cohesive movie universe similar to the MCU. I just wanted to share my thoughts on how a film universe could’ve been done and wanted to see people’s thoughts on it.

 I’m just going to make a basic outline on a three phase approach, similar to the MCU’s Infinity Saga. Each phase would build to a Justice League movie that closes the phase out and the Justice League would be based off the classic team of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter.

 
Phase 1:

This would obviously be the origin stories phase and each JL member would get their own solo movie. Now granted Superman and Batman could possibly be done without a straight-up origin story with as many solo movies as they’ve had and maybe just have quick flashbacks or references to their origins.

My only stipulation for each solo film for Phase 1 is that the heroes do not fight or come in contact with their arch enemies, which would come into play in the next phase. And possibly a couple of heroes could fight villains connected to Apokolips to have the presence of Darkseid ever looming in Phase 1. So maybe Superman could mainly be dealing with Intergang who have connections with Desaad and Kalibak or Wonder Woman could fight with Big Barda and the female furies (which could be a way to lead Big Barda down the superhero path).

The JL movie could be where the JL face off against Darkseid and while not full on defeating him, are at least able to stop him for this movie. I know a lot of people imagined Darkseid as a villain that caps off several phases similar to Thanos. I honestly feel he is a decent starting villain to bring the JL together that can always be brought back later as more powerful, plus the other JL villains I have in mind I feel can make the stakes much more personal as the movies progress.

 
Phase 2:

This is the phase where each hero would begin to be really challenged and face off against their arch enemies. So for instance Batman and Joker, Superman and Lex, Wonder Woman and Cheetah, Flash and Captain Cold, Green Lantern and Sinestro, Aquaman and Black Manta, and Martian Manhunter and Ma’alefa’ak.

Superman’s second movie with Lex could be the start to Phase 2. After Superman stops Lex in his own movie, Lex can come to the realization that stopping these heroes may require his own team. So he pops up at the end of each of the other movies recruiting the arch villains for each JL member.

This could also be a phase where other heroes are introduced to the world via each of the JL member’s solo movies or maybe having one or two new solo superhero movies, similar to Guardians and Ant-Man for the MCU’s phase 2, that way the world continues to expand and add new heroes. Maybe even in the Green Lantern movie you get an introduction to a new human, such as John Stewart, that will eventually become a Green Lantern.

Phase 2 would be capped off with a JL movie where, as already indicated, the JL fights against the Injustice League/Legion of Doom comprised of Lex, Joker, Cheetah, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Black Manta, and Ma’alefa’ak. The story would be loosely based off Tower of Babel where the Injustice League learn of Batman’s secret plans he has created to take down each member of the JL in an emergency and they get a hold of them to take out each JL member. Maybe somewhere along the way Coast City gets destroyed which plays a part into Hal Jordan’s journey for phase 3. After the Injustice League is eventually defeated, the movie ends with the team feeling betrayed by Batman and removing him from the team due to his secret plans to take them out.

 
Phase 3:

This phase would focus on a theme of reflections where each JL member fights a villain that is essentially an evil reflection of them. The remaining JL members begin to see Batman’s point of view on plans that can be used to take them out if they went rogue, but at the same time Batman realizes in his own movie how he may have gone too far with his actions in secretly creating his plans.

For the movies, you could have Superman face off against Zod, Wonder Woman against Grail (which would also be a nice way to reference Darkseid again after three phases), Flash against Reverse Flash, Aquaman against Ocean Master, Green Lantern against Parallax, Batman against Prometheus, and Martian Manhunter against White Martian (not sure on this one completely).

In Flash’s movie, this could introduce the multiverse which will come into play in the third and fourth JL movies.

In the Green Lantern movie, Hal’s grief over Coast City’s destruction could lead to him being corrupted by Parallax, which is where John Stewart could step in as a new Green Lantern to help stop the threat and John Stewart gets inducted into the JL at the end after Hal takes a leave of absence once he is free from Parallax (or Hal possibly dies too in order to really raise the stakes in this universe by showing an actual league member dying).

In Batman’s movie, as he fights against Prometheus, he can see a corrupted version of himself in Prometheus and realize his mistakes with being so secretive about his plans. This Batman movie could also be the last one before the JL movie and Superman could possibly come in to help Batman, where they both make amends, and allows for at least one World’s Finest team up movie.

Again there may be other movies where new heroes are introduced in Phase 3 to continue to expand the universe.

Finally to close out Phase 3, there would be a two part JL movie which would focus on Earth 3 and the Crime Syndicate. I imagine in the third movie, the JL members are approached by a good version of Lex from Earth 3 who asks for their help in overthrowing the Crime Syndicate. So the 6 JL members (with John Stewart being the new GL) take the fight to Earth 3. The JL would not win the first fight against the Crime Syndicate and the Crime Syndicate takes advantage of the knowledge of the existence of the JL’s Earth and go to conquer it. Of note, Batman may be mostly absent in this third JL movie to really get the feeling of at least one movie where Batman is off the team.

Then finally in the fourth JL movie, Batman finally makes amends with the remaining JL members after they have experienced what corrupted versions of themselves are like with the villains they faced in Phase 3 and after having just fought and lost to the Crime Syndicate. But Batman also admits his mistakes to the team too, possibly having also come across Owlman on his own in this movie too and learn even more what a corrupted version of him is like. The movie could end in an Endgame level fight of the JL vs Crime Syndicate on the JL’s Earth, along with the Crime Syndicate having brought over some evil versions of other heroes introduced in Phase 2 and 3 that could also all be involved in the fight.

This movie could end the three phase saga with the Justice League having finally expanded their membership and possibly a tease of a greater Crisis coming now that the multiverse has been introduced.",0,"My thoughts on what a shared DC Movie Universe could look like While I’ve enjoyed more of DC’s recent movie offerings, as a huge fan of DC, I still wish they could’ve built a more cohesive movie universe similar to the MCU. I just wanted to share my thoughts on how a film universe could’ve been done and wanted to see people’s thoughts on it.

 I’m just going to make a basic outline on a three phase approach, similar to the MCU’s Infinity Saga. Each phase would build to a Justice League movie that closes the phase out and the Justice League would be based off the classic team of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter.

 
Phase 1:

This would obviously be the origin stories phase and each JL member would get their own solo movie. Now granted Superman and Batman could possibly be done without a straight-up origin story with as many solo movies as they’ve had and maybe just have quick flashbacks or references to their origins.

My only stipulation for each solo film for Phase 1 is that the heroes do not fight or come in contact with their arch enemies, which would come into play in the next phase. And possibly a couple of heroes could fight villains connected to Apokolips to have the presence of Darkseid ever looming in Phase 1. So maybe Superman could mainly be dealing with Intergang who have connections with Desaad and Kalibak or Wonder Woman could fight with Big Barda and the female furies (which could be a way to lead Big Barda down the superhero path).

The JL movie could be where the JL face off against Darkseid and while not full on defeating him, are at least able to stop him for this movie. I know a lot of people imagined Darkseid as a villain that caps off several phases similar to Thanos. I honestly feel he is a decent starting villain to bring the JL together that can always be brought back later as more powerful, plus the other JL villains I have in mind I feel can make the stakes much more personal as the movies progress.

 
Phase 2:

This is the phase where each hero would begin to be really challenged and face off against their arch enemies. So for instance Batman and Joker, Superman and Lex, Wonder Woman and Cheetah, Flash and Captain Cold, Green Lantern and Sinestro, Aquaman and Black Manta, and Martian Manhunter and Ma’alefa’ak.

Superman’s second movie with Lex could be the start to Phase 2. After Superman stops Lex in his own movie, Lex can come to the realization that stopping these heroes may require his own team. So he pops up at the end of each of the other movies recruiting the arch villains for each JL member.

This could also be a phase where other heroes are introduced to the world via each of the JL member’s solo movies or maybe having one or two new solo superhero movies, similar to Guardians and Ant-Man for the MCU’s phase 2, that way the world continues to expand and add new heroes. Maybe even in the Green Lantern movie you get an introduction to a new human, such as John Stewart, that will eventually become a Green Lantern.

Phase 2 would be capped off with a JL movie where, as already indicated, the JL fights against the Injustice League/Legion of Doom comprised of Lex, Joker, Cheetah, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Black Manta, and Ma’alefa’ak. The story would be loosely based off Tower of Babel where the Injustice League learn of Batman’s secret plans he has created to take down each member of the JL in an emergency and they get a hold of them to take out each JL member. Maybe somewhere along the way Coast City gets destroyed which plays a part into Hal Jordan’s journey for phase 3. After the Injustice League is eventually defeated, the movie ends with the team feeling betrayed by Batman and removing him from the team due to his secret plans to take them out.

 
Phase 3:

This phase would focus on a theme of reflections where each JL member fights a villain that is essentially an evil reflection of them. The remaining JL members begin to see Batman’s point of view on plans that can be used to take them out if they went rogue, but at the same time Batman realizes in his own movie how he may have gone too far with his actions in secretly creating his plans.

For the movies, you could have Superman face off against Zod, Wonder Woman against Grail (which would also be a nice way to reference Darkseid again after three phases), Flash against Reverse Flash, Aquaman against Ocean Master, Green Lantern against Parallax, Batman against Prometheus, and Martian Manhunter against White Martian (not sure on this one completely).

In Flash’s movie, this could introduce the multiverse which will come into play in the third and fourth JL movies.

In the Green Lantern movie, Hal’s grief over Coast City’s destruction could lead to him being corrupted by Parallax, which is where John Stewart could step in as a new Green Lantern to help stop the threat and John Stewart gets inducted into the JL at the end after Hal takes a leave of absence once he is free from Parallax (or Hal possibly dies too in order to really raise the stakes in this universe by showing an actual league member dying).

In Batman’s movie, as he fights against Prometheus, he can see a corrupted version of himself in Prometheus and realize his mistakes with being so secretive about his plans. This Batman movie could also be the last one before the JL movie and Superman could possibly come in to help Batman, where they both make amends, and allows for at least one World’s Finest team up movie.

Again there may be other movies where new heroes are introduced in Phase 3 to continue to expand the universe.

Finally to close out Phase 3, there would be a two part JL movie which would focus on Earth 3 and the Crime Syndicate. I imagine in the third movie, the JL members are approached by a good version of Lex from Earth 3 who asks for their help in overthrowing the Crime Syndicate. So the 6 JL members (with John Stewart being the new GL) take the fight to Earth 3. The JL would not win the first fight against the Crime Syndicate and the Crime Syndicate takes advantage of the knowledge of the existence of the JL’s Earth and go to conquer it.
